Lately I've been spending a lot of time reading books and watching youTube videos on investing. For years I've heard a lot about the [Robinhood](https://robinhood.com/) and [Acorns](https://www.acorns.com/) apps, but there was nothing about them that made me want to try them out or move from my traditional brokerages. It's great that they have mobile apps and free trades for young investors and beginners, but I'd rather do my investments carefully on the desktop browser.

Soon enough I came across videos and blog posts recommending [M1 Finance](https://mbsy.co/wzGMJ). What stood out was that it allowed for custom pies, free trades, partial shares, and autoinvesting.

I really like looking at my portfolio as a pie.

## Pros
* You can buy partial shares.
* You can create individual, joint, and retirement accounts.
* Autoinvest feature
* Schedule deposits into account(s).
* Every penny can be put to work.
* Create custom pies.
* Pies that auto balance as you keep funding it.
* Create your own custom ETF!

## Cons
* Not for day traders
* Not for buying individual stocks/ETFs
* No Mutual funds.
* Only one trading window per day, in the morning before lunch.
* You buy *market price* of selected stock/ETFs.

## My Portfolios

Here are two portfolios I have set up with M1 Finance:

[Core 4 ETFs](https://m1.finance/a9qiZN9wE) - Based off of Rick Ferri's core four fund "cornerstone" portfolio (80/20). The Aggressive Growth portfolio has an allocation of 80% in equity and 20% in fixed income.

| ETF   | Symbol   | Percentage   |
|---  |---: |---:|
|Vanguard Total Stock Market   |VTI   |48%   |
|Vanguard Total International Stock   |VXUS   |24%   |
|Vanguard Total Bond Market   |BND   |20%   |
|Vanguard REIT   |VNQ   |8%   |

[Passive Income](https://m1.finance/rnRO6nTW7) - Based off of [Joseph Carlson's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbta0n8i6Rljh0obO7HzG9A) passive income pie, which is a dividend focused strategy in building wealth.

*Disclaimer, these portfolios are what I think fits my needs. Your goals and situation(s) will be different from mine, so be sure to do your own research when you invest your  money!*
