title: 'What''s next for Social Media?:  GPS-enabled applications'
---


There are some really cool GPS applications out there that are about to push the boundaries of technology and social media as we know it.  I remember years ago when I shared a link to [Loopt](https://www.loopt.com) with friends, pretty much everyone didn't like the idea of sharing that much information with each other.  Today, I already have a few friends jumping onto to use such an app.  Google has now also released a similar application out called [Google Latitude](https://www.google.com/latitude), but based on their Google login system.  I also just finished manually updating my G1 phone to use RC33, just so I could be one of the first to use the app.

What I'm a little surprised about is how [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com) doesn't have a social GPS application of their own.  Loopt already ties in to both Facebook and [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com) status feeds.  But there is so much untapped potential with what can be done with users that choose to interact using these applications.  Imagine a service that is able to provide relevant ads or suggestions based on your location?  The sky is literally the limit to what can be achieved.
