title: Chicago Code Camp 2 Pictures
---


I'm going to start posting pictures I take from various Tech Events I attend.  One, I'm doing it because I want to share visually, what the Tech community looks like.  And two, because I'm picking up photography as a hobby now.

The pictures below are from [Chicago Code Camp](https://chicagocodecamp.com/), which took place May 1st, 2010 at the Stuart Building at [IIT](https://iit.edu/).  They were taken by me with my Google Nexus One.
