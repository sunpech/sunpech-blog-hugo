I picked up a free ticket to [Mobile Camp LA](https://mobilecampla.com/) earlier this week and decided to attend. Overall I wasn't too impressed with the event. It may have very well been the first of it's kind aimed at developers, designers, and business folk. Anyway, I thought the venue was a bit of a mess as many things went wrong.

1. Earthquake drill at 10:15am (slightly distracting, but out of their control-- I understand)
2. A lot of sessions held in a one big open space separated by cloth dividers. Too noisy!
3. Microphone problems-- couldn't hear some sessions at all!
4. Power outages-- no presentation slides or projectors!
5. Cancelations and running behind time (somewhat normal, but there seemed to be quite a few).

Anyway, it was still enjoyable and I shouldn't complain since it was free for me.
One more complaint in general, here was one session I ended up not enjoying where the speaker was more interested in promoting his own product than talking about technology or problem solving. I just do not like sitting through some kind of product advertisement for an hour.

The interesting thing I walked away with was how many new products/services Adobe was coming out with for not just designers, but also developers. Check out [html.adobe.com](https://html.adobe.com/) to see all these brand new stuff. They are definitely pushing the [Creative Cloud](https://www.adobe.com/products/creativecloud.html). Something I'll have to keep my eye on since I use Photoshop and Lightroom pretty heavily these days.
