title: 'My New Phone: Google''s Nexus One'
---


Yesterday Google gave a presentation on the Google Nexus One.  I watched it on the [Gizmodo Liveblog](https://live.gizmodo.com/).  Ten minutes after reading the blog and looking at the pictures, I was sold.  I knew I was eventually going to get it, but I didn't know until that moment that that was the moment I was going to get it.

I bought the phone yesterday, 1/5/2010, at 1:05pm.  Overnight FedEx shipping (free).  It arrived today at 1:22pm.  Awesome.

The Nexus One can be purchased here: [https://www.google.com/phone](https://www.google.com/phone)
