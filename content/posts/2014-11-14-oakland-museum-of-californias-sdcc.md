The [Oakland Museum of California](https://www.museumca.org) has one of my photos from San Diego Comic Con on display in their exhibit: [Sunshine and Superheroes: San Diego Comic-Con](https://www.museumca.org/exhibit/sunshine-and-superheroes-san-diego-comic-con). A few days ago I had the opportunity to visit and took some photos.

The exhibit runs from May 23, 2014 to May 31, 2015.

Below is the photo I took at SDCC in 2013 that they used. It's taken on the escalators leading up to the ticket booths.

Full set of photos can be found [here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/mJMioHrHvkD4tJ9S9).

Here are some of my pictures from the museum and the SDCC exhibit:

That's me standing in front of my photo blown up to the size of a wall!

The museum is comfortably small and had a lot of school children visiting. If you are in the area, give it a visit.
