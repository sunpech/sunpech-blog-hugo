title: Google Plus Photographer's Photowalk at Golden Gate Park
---


Last week I was up in San Francisco May 21-23 for the [Google+ Photographer's Conference](https://gpluspc.com/). On Monday, there was an optional photowalk at about ten locations. I attended the one led by [Scott Kelby](https://scottkelby.com/) at [Golden Gate Park](https://www.golden-gate-park.com/).

The photowalk was pretty fun. It's the third photowalk I've been on so far, and in general I like to stray from the group, go at my own pace, and take shots of everything I find interesting. I socialized a bit, but the part I enjoy is seeing how other photogs at the same location on the same day take photographs.

The weather was a bit dreary with a lot of overcast. I ended up using a lot of HDR to help spruce things up. I used the [Canon 5D Mark 3](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007FGYZFI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sunpech-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B007FGYZFI)'s HDR feature to produce the pictures. I post processed with [Adobe Lightroom 4.1](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html) (RC2). I also used some nifty [Adobe Lightroom Instagram Presets](https://www.caseymacphoto.com/lightroom-instagram-presets) on a few pictures.

I'll have a post on the actual conference soon.
