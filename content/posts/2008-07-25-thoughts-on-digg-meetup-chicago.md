title: Thoughts on Digg Meetup Chicago
---


First off, let me say that I enjoy reading some of the articles posted on [Digg](https://www.digg.com/)... well, I want to emphasize some.  It's a voting system, so there's a lot of crap stories, and just a few winners here and there.  But sometimes those stories are worth it.  Sometimes...

Anyway, I went to the Digg Meetup event yesterday with a co-worker and I thought it was just ok.  [Kevin Rose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rose) spoke a little, threw out some free schwag, interacted with the crowd, typical stuff.  But the real reason I went was my hopes of hearing something about the [Google in final negotiations to acquire Digg for $200 million](https://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/22/google-in-final-negotiations-to-acquire-digg-for-around-200-million/) headline.  Which I didn't hear.  Oh and the free schwag, which I also didn't get.  Although a t-shirt did fly by my head, but Smartbar was so dark I couldn't even see the floor and chair in front of me.

I'm just really curious as to what [Google](https://www.google.com/) or any Digg staff had to say publicly about this *acquisition*.  Although the digg system is somewhat refreshing, the community and users are not.  Too many stories and comments are entered without truly adding to the discussion.  There is a way to bury these, which is nice, but again, that is based on their voting system.

Not that I'm saying Digg is like MySpace (which I hate, yes the word is hate).  No, in fact I still prefer Digg over the moderated [Slashdot](https://slashdot.org/).

I just don't see how this adds any value to what Google has.  I like [Google News]("https://www.news.google.com) as it is (although it could use a bit of a facelift).  Is it for the money?  I know Google would be good for Digg, but what does Digg do for Google?

Here is the Digg: [Digg's Chicago Town Hall Pics](https://digg.com/tech_news/Digg_s_Chicago_Town_Hall_Pics_sub_Diggs_Tribune_strategy?OTC-ig).

I think their competitors are worth checking out:
