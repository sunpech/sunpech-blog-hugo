title: Pictures from the July 2010 Tech Events in Chicago
---


I made sure to take a lot of photos this month.

### Tuesday July 6, 2010
[Chicago Ruby](https://chicagoruby.org/) had a meeting over at [ThoughtWorks](]https://www.thoughtworks.com/). Snapped a few photos there.  Very cool talks.  And of course, pizza.  You can sign up for these meetings at: [Chicago Ruby Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ChicagoRuby).  There was a Hack Night on Thursday of the week, but I did not take any photos.

Presentations by [@chrisjpowers](https://twitter.com/chrisjpowers) and [@blakesmith](https://twitter.com/blakesmith).

### Wednesday July 14, 2010
Here are the pictures from the [MongoDB 101](https://chicagoalt.net/event/July2010Meeting-MongoDB-101) presentation by [JC Grubbs](https://www.thegrubbsian.com/) ([@thegrubbsian](https://twitter.com/thegrubbsian)).  It was quite a large group that attended.  Also the first time that I snapped up photos with my Canon Rebel XT.

After the meeting, went out to [Elephant and Castle](https://www.elephantcastle.com/) for some GeekBeer with [@thegrubbsian](https://twitter.com/thegrubbsian), [@veezus](https://twitter.com/veezus), [@escoz](https://twitter.com/escoz), [@DavidSilvaSmith](https://twitter.com/DavidSilvaSmith), [@bwilken](https://twitter.com/bwilken), [@dugan](https://twitter.com/dugan), and [@delitescere](https://twitter.com/delitescere).  As you can see from the picture, it wasn't long into our beers and tech talks before someone whipped out their macbook for some code sharing action.  Actually, I think the argument was about how much more productive Vim was over the Visual Studio IDE.
