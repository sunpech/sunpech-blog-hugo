title: Free Microsoft Development Tools for Students on DreamSpark
---


On [Microsoft Dreamspark](https://www.dreamspark.com), they have a very nice list of Microsoft development tools that you can download for FREE.  Mind you, these aren't just the free editions of their software, these are **Standard** to **Professional** editions that individuals and companies pay a lot of money for.

*The catch is that you need to be a student with a student email.  (Something like student.name@myuniversity.edu).*

They currently offer:

* Microsoft SQL Server 2008 Developer Edition
* Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Professional Edition 
* Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 Professional Edition 
* Microsoft Expression Studio 1.0 
* Microsoft Expression Studio 2 Trial Edition (includes Web, Blend, Media, and Design) 
* Microsoft Windows Server 2003 R2 Standard Edition 
* Microsoft Windows Server 2008 Standard Edition 
* IT Academy Student Pass
