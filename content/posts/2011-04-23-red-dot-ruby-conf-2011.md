As part of my trip back to the US, I attended [Red Dot Ruby Conf 2011](https://reddotrubyconf.com/) on April 22-23, 2011. This event takes place in Singapore, at the [Singapore Management University](https://www.smu.edu.sg/) (SMU).

I had an awesome time. I enjoy going to these social technology events. Got a chance to talk and hang out with a lot of smart folks. I really enjoy the Ruby/Rails community

Quick summary of the talks from the two days:

#### Day 1
Pivotal Labs is awesome. So is Agile. Everyone uses Pivotal Tracker. Everyone is hiring. *(Note this is meant in good fun)*

#### Day 2
A more technical day with code examples, MongoDB, etc ending with a coding competition. Everyone is hiring.

Here are some of my favorite pictures I took:

The two day schedule:

I woke up a bit late and arrived a bit tardy to the conference. This is what I heard when I was registering:

```
P1: "And who are you?"
P2: "I'm Matz."
... *(laughter ensues)*
```

### Pictures

Matz was also late

I'd say about ~250 people in attendance.

We got Robin, Superman, and Batman!

Dave Thomas (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/pragdave">@pragdave</a>) presenting on day two on how Singlish is similar to Ruby. Easily my favorite talk of the conference.
