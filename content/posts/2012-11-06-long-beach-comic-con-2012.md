title: Long Beach Comic Con 2012

Over the weekend I attended [Long Beach Comic Con](https://www.longbeachcomiccon.com/) held at the [Long Beach Convention Center](https://www.longbeachcc.com/) It's not as big as [San Diego Comic Con](https://www.comic-con.org/cci/) nor [Comikaze Expo](https://comikazeexpo.com/), but it definitely had a more collector's paradise feel to it.

I actually didn't take too many pictures myself as I was head deep in the comic book bins looking for deals on actual comic books. Normally I'm more of a trade paperback (TPB) kind of comic reader, but recently started picking up some individual titles again. I'll try to have a blog post up covering some of my more recent readings.

There also weren't too many people dressed up-- but then again I went only on Sunday, the day after the costume/masquerade party. I definitely missed taking pictures of some pretty nice costumes because I was mostly there for the comics, not panels or costumes really. Sorry to disappoint if that was what you were hoping for!

Full album can be found [here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/DoWysRnNDaVitov4A).
