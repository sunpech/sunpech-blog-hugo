title: Getting the G1 in one week
---


Next week, on October 22, I should be getting my pre-ordered [T-Mobile G1](https://www.t-mobileg1.com/), in black.  Sadly though, in order to pre-order this device, I had to extend my contract with T-Mobile until September 28, 2010.  I found out the exact date by a letter they sent me thanking me for choosing to continue my relationship and extending my contract with them.

Let me get one thing straight, I extended the contract only to get my hand on a device running [Google Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(mobile_device_platform)).  I love pretty much everything that comes from Google.  Everything.  And I want to be one of the first to get my hands on this toy.  Even though it's costing me $300.
