title: Trip to Singapore
---


I went to Singapore over the weekend (April 21-25) for <a href="https://reddotrubyconf.com/">Red Dot Ruby Conf</a>. It was my first time to Singapore. I didn't travel around too much, as I was in a conference for two full days (Friday and Saturday).

Some things I noticed about Singapore:

<ul>
  <li>No mosquitoes</li>
  <li>Hot and humid like Bangkok, but more pleasant</li>
  <li>Plenty of jay-walkers</li>
  <li>Seems the major things to do are shop and eat</li>
  <li>3G is everywhere, generally very good</li>
  <li>Singlish takes some getting used to</li>
  <li>Singapore is full of folks from everywhere</li>
  <li>Super clean everywhere</li>
  <li>No traffic-- seems well managed</li>
</ul>

I ate out often at hawker centers.

Checked out Orchard Road.
