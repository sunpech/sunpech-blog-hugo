title: Trip to Singapore
---


I went to Singapore over the weekend (April 21-25) for [Red Dot Ruby Conf](https://reddotrubyconf.com/). It was my first time to Singapore. I didn't travel around too much, as I was in a conference for two full days (Friday and Saturday).

Some things I noticed about Singapore:

* No mosquitoes
* Hot and humid like Bangkok, but more pleasant
* Plenty of jay-walkers
* Seems the major things to do are shop and eat
* 3G is everywhere, generally very good
* Singlish takes some getting used to
* Singapore is full of folks from everywhere
* Super clean everywhere
* No traffic-- seems well managed

I ate out often at hawker centers.
