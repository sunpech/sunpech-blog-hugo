It's been more than a year since I [last posted about M1 Finance](/2019/10/m1-finance/). Just wanted to give an update on my investing journey on what I've learned and adapted along the way. 

## Investing Strategy Changes

The 2020 year has been a pandemic year where we had a bit of a recession in March/April. Dividends of companies got suspended as well as lost value in favor of many growth and stay-at-home stocks.

In response, I droppped my dividend focused portfolio in favor of just keeping an ETFs only portfolio. I didn't want to have 50+ stocks in an account where I was just incrementally purchased fractional shares every week. I want my numbers to go up, but I'd rather keep it more simple with fewer holdings that I have more conviction in.

I changed my Core 4 ETFs in favor of some more growth. My changes:

* Sold out of International (VXUS), Bonds (BND), and REITS(VNQ) ETFs completely
* Added Ark Invest's ARKK and ARKF
* Increased VTI from 48% to 65%

| ETF   | Symbol   | Percentage   |
|---  |---: |---:|
|Vanguard Total Stock Market   |VTI   |65%   |
|Ark Innovation ETF   |ARKK   |20%   |
|Ark Fintech Innovation ETF   |ARKF   |15%   |

My performance of value over time has been very satifactory. I pretty much kept to a weekly deposit schedule (Wednesdays), with occasional boost in an amount when the market dipped significantly.

## Ark Invest

I love the work of [Ark Invest](https://ark-invest.com/). Besides an a simple and cheap S&P500 index fund ETF, I recommend the [ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ARKK?p=ARKK&.tsrc=fin-srch). It's their premiere ETF they offer that contains the best of the best innovative companies.

Ark Invest's CEO/CIO, [Cathie Wood](https://twitter.com/cathiedwood) and her analysts do an amazing job finding innovating companies for their portfolios.

They have an expense ratio of 0.75% on [all their ETFs](https://ark-funds.com/). Not expensive, but also not cheap either! But I think it's worth it for them to do the work/research that I cannot do. The results speaks for itself. 

Besides ARKK, I like ARKF and ARKG. I'm very bullish on Fintech and Genomic technology.

## M1 Finance as a Brokerage

M1 succeeds at making some difficult things easy, but struggles with the easy things. Fractional shares, auto-invest, dollar cost averaging, and portfolio allocation (pies) are all amazing and well done. **But their customer support is a weak point as a brokerage.** This seems to be a problem at a lot of the smaller start-up brokerages like [Robinhood](https://robinhood.com/us/en/). They are great at getting young people to be clients on a great easy to use mobile platform, but they don't have customer service! You will not find customer service a problem at more traditional brokerages like [Fidelity](https://www.fidelity.com/) or [Charles Schwab](https://www.schwab.com/).

When I was trying to close one of my accounts with M1, I contacted support via email and wasn't able to get the request completed for over a month. I know they use [Zen Desk](https://www.zendesk.com/) for their customer support. I had to follow up several times before someone took action!

## Final Thoughts

I will continue to use M1 Finance as a brokerage. As I am bullish on my investments, I also believe M1 Finance will continue to grow in the coming years.
