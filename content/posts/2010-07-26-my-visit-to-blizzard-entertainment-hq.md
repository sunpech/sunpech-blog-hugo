title: My visit to Blizzard Entertainment HQ
---


On my way to Los Angeles from San Diego, I had the opportunity to stop by the [Blizzard](https://www.blizzard.com/) HQ in Irvine, California.  I must say that they have an awesome campus with very developer/designer friendly offices.  Toys and models everywhere!

Here some pictures, full set of pictures can be found [here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/UafLMb2x11BcWma69).
