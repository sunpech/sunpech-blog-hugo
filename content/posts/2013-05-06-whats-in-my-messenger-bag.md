title: What's In My Messenger Bag
---

Not long ago I posted [what's in my camera bag](/2013/04/whats-in-my-camera-bag). I thought I would follow up on what I carry in my other bag-- especially when I travel. Here's what I *typically* have in my messenger bag.

You're probably wondering why I have so many mobile devices/readers. The Galaxy Nexus is my phone of course. I always have this with me.

The Kindle Fire I have I use mostly for playing a game or reading my Twitter feed. It also runs a custom ROM, [Jandycane](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1766829). I [blogged on how you can root the Kindle Fire](/2012/06/putting-cyanogenmod-on-kindle-fire) and put a custom Android ROM on there. a while back.

The Kindle Paperwhite I use for actually reading ebooks. It's actually really nice and clear-- very easy on the eyes for reading *anywhere*. I while back I [tweeted](https://twitter.com/sunpech/status/304085600926060544) about winning the device at a Amazon Cloud Services meetup in Los Angeles.

Besides all the gadgets, I highly recommend the messenger bag from [Ono](https://www.onabags.com/). They're well made, stylish, and just holds everything you see here.
