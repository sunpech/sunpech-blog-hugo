title: Tapping into the Cloud
---


A few years ago I envisioned a world where computers would return back to acting more like terminal PCs connected to a mainframe.  A world where accessing files/applications locally would be a thing of the past.  In a way, that's what [Cloud Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) seems to be about.  A user can be on any computer (albeit a PC, a Mac, or a Linux box), all that is required is Internet connection and a web browser, and the user can run most of his/her computing needs.

I think it's interesting that applications these days are almost synonymous with web applications than with the original desktop application.  I wanted to share some of my favorite online applications with everyone, and encourage you to also tap into the cloud.

### Email and RSS feeds

I'm relying less on using [Microsoft Outlook](https://www.microsoft.com/outlook/) and/or [Mozilla Thunderbird](https://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird/) to collect my email and RSS feeds.  I utilize both [Gmail](https://mail.google.com/) and [Google Reader](https://reader.google.com/) for all that now.  I can read/add/search for anything on either my home PC, laptop, or work PC.

### Bookmarking

One of the main reasons I wrote my own blog application back in 1999/2000 was because I wanted a way to bookmark interesting websites.  I hated that I could bookmark a website on one computer, but I wouldn't be able to get at it from another PC.  A classmate originally wrote it in Perl, but I translated it to PHP.  Here is the [link](https://cs-people.bu.edu/spong/articles/).

[Delicious](https://delicious.com/) does a fantastic job of this.  Good job [Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/) on acquiring them in 2005!  As far as I know, this was the first site that I started to tag with.

### Pictures, Videos, and Instant Messaging
[Picasa](https://picasa.google.com/) is my favorite site to store all my picture albums.  [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) isn't so much a greta place to store videos, as it is to share them.  But more or less becoming the same thing.  [Meebo](https://www.meebo.com/) is pretty nice in how it collects all the IM services in one place.  Although, honestly, I'm still a big user of the [Digsby](https://www.digsby.com/) desktop application.

### Office Suite
I can't say I write my word docs or excel spreadsheets online yet.  I know there's [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/), but I haven't really caught onto that just yet.  I'm just really more of a [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/).
