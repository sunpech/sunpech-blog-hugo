title: Photos from San Francisco
---

I was up in San Francisco in late November and early December last year. It was a very last minute trip, but one I wanted to do for such a long time. I've always wanted to get some shots of the iconic Golden Gate Bridge in SF-- without any fog. My prior visits have always been foggy and I could never see the full bridge.

Well, this trip was somewhat dedicated to visiting the bridge several times to get some shots-- to which I was finally able to get some shots without fog. You can view the full album [here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/9N369mQMxvsJtxBs9).

Here are some of my favorite shots:
