title: Pictures of Chicago and the Millennium Park Bean

I was at an event last week at the rooftop of 63 E. Lake Street and I was able to take some photos of the Millennium Park Bean and parts of Chicago.

These photos were taken with my Canon Digital Rebel XT with a Canon EF-S 55-250mm f/4.0-5.6 IS Telephoto Zoom Lens.
