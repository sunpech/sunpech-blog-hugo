title: Looking forward to 2008
---


As 2007 comes to a close, it marks the end of one year, and the beginning of another.  So too does it bring an end more or less of my blogging on [spong.org](https://spong.org).  It was a personal side project of I started 9 years ago before blogs and other free services were available.  Now I'm reading to officially say that I'm stopping development on it as I have other things in my life I wish to focus on.  I do plan on keeping the spong.org domain and hosting, but the vaporware known as spongblog 2.0 is closed.

The biggest reason behind this decision is that there are just too many other services that scale much better than whatever free hosting service I use (whether it be 1&1, godaddy, or discountasp.net).  I'm looking to downgrade my service plan to save money, once I have properly migrated all the old posts to static HTML pages.

Anyway, [sunpech.blogspot.com](https://sunpech.blogspot.com) will be my new blog going forward.
