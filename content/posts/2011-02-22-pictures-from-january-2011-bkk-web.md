title: Pictures from January 2011 BKK Web Meetup

A recent group I started to attend is [BKK Web Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/bkk-web/) (short for Web Design, UX Design and Web Development Meetup Group in Bangkok).

Below are the pictures I took from the [January Meetup: Computer Vision with Android](https://www.meetup.com/bkk-web/events/15940959/). The presentation is by Andrea Gagliardi La Gala.
