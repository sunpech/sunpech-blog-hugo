title: My Impressions of the G1 running Android
---


I've had my [G1](https://www.t-mobileg1.com/) for a few weeks now.  My overall impressions are pretty good.  I like the touch screen, I like the free applications available through the market app, and I definitely enjoy the web browsing experience on the 3G network over my old Blackberry Pearl on the EDGE network.

But I do have a few complaints:

* **Battery Life is too short**.  I can maybe go for a maximum of 2 days without a recharge if I very minimal use of the phone.  But I suppose this is understandable since it is 3G and touchscreen.
* **3G network still not available everywhere**.  I go to the Chicago suburbs, and I'm back on the EDGE network when I want to browse.
* **Facebook's regular website is not G1 friendly**.  This is not the G1's fault.  In fact I use the Facebook iphone website instead.
* **Gmail's contact does not sync well**.  This is what pisses me off the most.  Since your contact list is from your Gmail account (at least it should be for back-up purposes), it's a one way sync: Gmail app to phone.  If you enter a new contact in the phone, it will not sync up into the Gmail app, or at least not quickly.
