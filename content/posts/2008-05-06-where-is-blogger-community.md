title: Where is the Blogger Community?
---


I recently started a new blog over at [Vox.com](https://www.vox.com) after my older sister recommended me the site after a friend of hers recommended it to her.  It's a social blogging website that emphasizes on the concept of a neighborhood; essentially socializing with other people with common interests, etc.

Anyway, I still really like [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com), but where the heck is the community?  I'm sure I can search for it through Google, but can't there be some kind of interface that can help users find each other?

I am quite disappointed.  Blogger is simple, straightforward, and customizable, but it lacks web 2.0's social aspect.  It's just a blogging service.  I have no plans to stop blogging here, but Vox does look interesting...

Anyway, here is the address to my Vox blog:

[sunpech.vox.com](https://sunpech.vox.com)

Vox is created by [Six Apart](https://www.sixapart.com/) (also the creators of [MoveableType](https://www.movabletype.org/), [TypePad](https://www.typepad.com/), and [HuffingtonPost](https://www.huffingtonpost.com).  Yes, that is quite the resume.
