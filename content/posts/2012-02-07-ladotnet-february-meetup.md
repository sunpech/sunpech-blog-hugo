title: LADOTNET February Meetup

I attended the [LADOTNET February meetup](https://www.ladotnet.org/events/48342932/) held at [Blankspaces](https://www.blankspaces.com/) last night. The event topic was: <b>Start ups, Tech and Business Trends with John Shiple</b>. The attendance was pretty massive as this user group is getting bigger and bigger every month. I enjoyed the speaker and presentation a lot. I do notice that it's a trend that there are a lot of startup businesses growing outside of Silicon Valley.

More speaker information:
