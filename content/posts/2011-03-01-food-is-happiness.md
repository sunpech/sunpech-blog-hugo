title: Food Is Happiness
---


I started a new blog/website over at <a href="https://www.foodishappiness.com/">foodishappiness.com</a>. I exported all my food posts from this site as well as from <a href="https://bestburgerintown.blogspot.com/">bestburgerintown.blogspot.com</a> (which I've abandoned) and imported them into the new site. It's just something new I wanted to try out, to see if I could generate content from my food/eating passion. I'm still on an "eating tour" of Bangkok, Thailand so to speak.

<a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-0hSDcQ2NkWc/TWySjHAavKI/AAAAAAAAhBg/s-7Ytz4ee5g/s1600/steven_icon.jpg" alt=""><img   border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-0hSDcQ2NkWc/TWySjHAavKI/AAAAAAAAhBg/s-7Ytz4ee5g/s320/steven_icon.jpg" alt="" /></a>

I know many say that <a href="https://www.google.com/#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;site=&amp;source=hp&amp;q=blogs+are+dead&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g1g-v2&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;psj=1&amp;bav=on.1,or.&amp;fp=a2885925ea8ae0">blogs are dead</a>. I certainly hope not. As much as I like <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, I just don't think 140 characters is enough to express many things.

So read up on my food adventures, please turn to <a href="https://www.foodishappiness.com/">Food Is Happiness</a> site or follow <a href="https://twitter.com/foodishappiness">@foodishappiness</a> on the Twitter. This site is still my personal blog, which will be less on food, more on photography, travel, and maybe some books. Happy eating!
