title: Food Is Happiness
---

I started a new blog/website over at [foodishappiness.com](https://www.foodishappiness.com/). I exported all my food posts from this site as well as from [bestburgerintown.blogspot.com](https://bestburgerintown.blogspot.com/) (which I've abandoned) and imported them into the new site. It's just something new I wanted to try out, to see if I could generate content from my food/eating passion. I'm still on an "eating tour" of Bangkok, Thailand so to speak.

I know many say that [blogs are dead](https://www.google.com/#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;site=&amp;source=hp&amp;q=blogs+are+dead&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g1g-v2&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;psj=1&amp;bav=on.1,or.&amp;fp=a2885925ea8ae0). I certainly hope not. As much as I like [Twitter](https://twitter.com/), I just don't think 140 characters is enough to express many things.

So read up on my food adventures, please turn to [Food Is Happiness](https://www.foodishappiness.com/) site or follow [@foodishappiness](https://twitter.com/foodishappiness) on the Twitter. This site is still my personal blog, which will be less on food, more on photography, travel, and maybe some books. Happy eating!
