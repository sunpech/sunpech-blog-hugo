I finished reading [Rework](https://amzn.to/2P1f0xt) by the founders of [37Signals](https://www.37signals.com/). I really really enjoyed the book. The chapters were concise and to the point.

Here are my favorite chapters:

* Learning from mistakes is overrated
* Planning is guessing
* No time is no excuse
* Outside money is Plan Z
* Embrace constraints
* Focus on won't change
* Interruption is the enemy of productivity
* Meetings are toxic
* Your estimates suck
* Underdo your competition
* Say no by default
* Emulate chefs
* Drug dealers get it right
* Do it yourself first
* Everybody works
* They're not thirteen
* Don't scar on the first cut


I highly recommend people to pick up a copy if you are at all interested in how a great business should be run.
