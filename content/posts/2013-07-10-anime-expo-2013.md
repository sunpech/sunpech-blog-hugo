Over the Fourth of July week I attended [Anime Expo](https://www.anime-expo.org) (AX) at the [Los Angeles Convention Center](https://www.lacclink.com) (LACC). [Last year I went](/2012/07/anime-expo-2012) and took over 1500 photos. This year I took over 1700 photos.

Full albums can be found here on G+ (and Facebook-- FB):

I did not go on Day 4, on Sunday. I was just too tired to take any more pictures, plus it's a shorter day. I typically don't buy anything in the exhibit hall. I'm mostly there to take pictures of the awesome cosplayers.

#### Camera Talk...

I brought my Canon 5DM3 with a Canon 24-105 f/4 L lens and flash-- which is my group shot / full body shot camera. I also attached a [A Better Bounce Card](https://abetterbouncecard.com/) to the flash to help diffuse the light a bit. My secondary camera is the Canon 60D with a Canon 50mm f/1.4 lens-- which was my portrait lens on the cropped sensor. I attached the 5DM3 to a [BlackRapid Sport strap](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HWC6PI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005HWC6PI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=sunpech-20). And my bag is the ever reliable [ThinkTank Retrospective 30](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039ZJ15I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0039ZJ15I&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=sunpech-20). This was all rather heavy to carry around all day and crouch on the ground with. I felt like I was doing lunges with 15 pound weights all day!

I post-processed everything in [Adobe Lightroom 5](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html). Yes I upgraded from version 4 and absolutely love this latest version! I barely have to take anything into Photoshop anymore-- which greatly improves my workflow/efficiency.

Next week is [San Diego Comic Con](https://www.comic-con.org/)! I'll be there to take more photos!  Although I must say, out of all the various conventions I've been to, AX has the best fans and cosplayers. They are hardcore and super-dedicated, and put a lot of effort into their costumes.  This is probably my fourth AX, and every time I go, I see new costumes and learn about an anime I've never heard of before. This year was [Attack on Titan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Titan)

The line system they have at AX is probably the best I've seen. I'm talking about waiting in line. I love how they taped up queuing system that makes the best use of space for the thousands of people in line.
