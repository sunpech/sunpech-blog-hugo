### Spiked Cocoa Event on August 19, 2010

[Fading Red](https://www.fadingred.com/) hosted a [Spiked Cocoa](https://spikedcocoa.com/) event.  It was pretty interesting as this was the first time I went to an event that comprised mostly of Apple enthusiasts/developers.  I must say it was a different crowd than Microsoft/.Net, Android/Java, and the Ruby guys.  Which is a good thing.  In attendance with me were: [@escoz](https://twitter.com/escoz), [@bwilken](https://twitter.com/bwilken), and [@klmcmahon](https://twitter.com/klmcmahon).

Presentations (*lightning talks* as they called it) from the website:

* [@rentzsch](https://twitter.com/rentzsch) on Core Data
* [@mccarron](https://twitter.com/mccarron) on Converting Apps from iPhone to iPad
* [@hammerdr](https://twitter.com/hammerdr) on Cappucinno

### Software Craftsman that happen to like whiskey on August 31, 2010

[@bwilken](https://twitter.com/bwilken/) put together a meetup at The Boiler Room at 2210 North California Avenue, Chicago.  It was a very casual and laid back event for software craftsman.  The PB&amp;J was awesome too.  PB&amp;J = Pizza, Beer, &amp; Jameson.
