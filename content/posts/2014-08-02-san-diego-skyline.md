I really like the city of San Diego. It's a very clean city with little to no smog in the air, unlike Los Angeles.

I was there for [Comic Con](https://www.comic-con.org/cci) a few days early [last week](/2014/07/san-diego-comic-con-2014). So I put aside some time to go take pictures of the skyline from Coronado Island. I did a little research on [500px](https://www.500px.com/) and picked a spot that had a clear shot of the skyline.

I was planning to take shots in bulb-mode, but I forgot to bring my shutter release. So I just stuck in aperture-priority mode around f/8 on my tripod and hoped that no ferries would come into the shot for the long exposure.
