After hearing that several friends will be doing the <a href="https://www.shamrockshuffle.com/">Shamrock Shuffle</a> this year, I decided I wanted to challenge myself to it again.  I did it two years ago, in 2007.  I did little to no training for that, and ran at about a 13min/mile pace.  I'm hoping to bring that down to a 10min/mile pace with some proper training.

I look at this as a way to start out 2009 and hopefully, the rest of my life:  As a fresh start to making a better me.
