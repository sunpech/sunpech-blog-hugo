For a long time [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) was my default browser. I switched to [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) a few years ago due to some concern that I was giving too much personal information to Google. One thing that always bugged me about Firefox was how slow it was compared to Chrome. 

Recently I decided to swith to use [Brave](https://brave.com/?ref=sun686). 

## Brave's Mission

> Brave is on a mission to fix the web by giving users a safer, faster and better browsing experience while growing support for content creators through a new attention-based ecosystem of rewards. ([source](https://brave.com/about/))

Thus far the experience has been great. For one, it's much faster than Firefox. 

I still don't like the amount of ads and tracking that goes on the Internet, so I still use extensions. I recommend [Privacey Badger](https://privacybadger.org/) and [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en).

The biggest drawback is that it currently has disabled syncing your Brave settings/bookmarks across devices. See: [How do I set up Sync?](https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021218111-How-do-I-set-up-Sync-)

## Final Thoughts

I'm not saying that Chrome, Firefox, and Safari are terrible browsers and that Brave is the one true web browser everyone should be using. No. I'm just saying that it's moved up to be my default browser, as I still have the other browsers installed on all my Macs.

Safari on macOS is incredibly fast, but simply lacks extensions I use regularly.

I urge users to give Brave a try if they haven't already.
