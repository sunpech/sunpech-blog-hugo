title: My HTPC Setup
---


A few months ago I [blogged](/2012/01/western-digital-wd-tv-live-streaming-media-player) about my new purchase of the [WD TV Live Streaming Media Player](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005KOZNBW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sunpech-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005KOZNBW). I still enjoy it immensely, and a few people have inquired about what is needed.

So here's a list of what's in my setup:

This is the heart of the [Home Theatre PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_theater_PC) (HTPC).

[WD Elements 3 TB USB 2.0 Desktop External Hard Drive](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004SH5VQ4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sunpech-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004SH5VQ4)
I don't recommend attaching more than one external hard drive via a USB hub. It's just too slow and cumbersome. So instead I recommend a nice big external USB HDD.

[HDMI Cables](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O5N5AI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sunpech-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000O5N5AI%22%3EHDMI%20Cable%20(15%20feet)%3C/a%3E)

Assuming you have a nice and modern TV, you should really be using HDMI to carry the video/audio. Also applicable if you are using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AV_receiver">receiver</a>. Do not, I repeat, *do not purchase HDMI cables at your local Best Buy*-- they are ripping you off! These should cost no more than a few dollars ($4-6) each.

[Belkin 7-Foot RJ45 CAT 5e Snagless Molded Patch Cable (Gray)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000J1V5/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sunpech-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00000J1V5)
There are nice services such as youTube and social network plugins available with the media player, so I highly recommend you attach the device to your home network's router.

[Belkin Pivot-Plug Surge Protectors](]https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JE9LD4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sunpech-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000JE9LD4)

This is my favorite surge protector. The swiveling heads is a godsend if you have a variety of devices to plug in.

I will also add that the media player plays most movie files you may have. I've only come across a few files that it won't play correctly. Also, if you should come across some general problems with  any video file stopped working, just restart the device.

Hope this helps.
