Last night I went to my second Drink and Click LA meetup in [downtown Artwalk](https://downtownartwalk.org/). Specifically we checked out [The Last Bookstore](https://lastbookstorela.com/), which is an amazing place to walk around and take photos if you are into books and little trinkets. Generally they ask you to check your bag at what I think is their main entrance, but the other entrance they do not in case you want to bring your camera bag in, which is what we all did.
