title: Western Digital WD TV Live Streaming Media Player
---

Since I moved to LA, I've been without my old PC that runs [XBMC](https://xbmc.org). For a Home Theater PC ([HTPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_theater_PC)), the PC is decent, but it's large, loud, and not in California. So I went on Amazon and bought the [Western Digital WD TV Live Streaming Media Player](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005KOZNBW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sunpech-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005KOZNBW) for $90 US. Behold, my new HTPC.

I've been using it for a few days, and overall I'm pretty happy with it. I was able to hook up my external USB hard drives to a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008VFAF/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sunpech-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00008VFAF">D-Link DUB-H7 High Speed USB 2.0 7-Port Hub</a>, and connect that to my new HTPC. It detects all the externally connected drives, but it won't mount them all at once-- you'll have to swap through the user interface, which is pretty simple.

Oh, I also recommend getting some [HDMI cables](https://amzn.to/30NapFL), to make wiring simple.

So now I can watch all my movies, TV shows, tech videos, and so forth, on a big screen LCD TV. For those of you that own a lot of digital content and don't want to build your own HTPC, this is an incredibly cheap and simple solution. I highly recommend it.
