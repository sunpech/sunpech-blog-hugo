title: Google Plus Photographer's Conference
---

Last week I attended the [Google+ Photographer's Conference](https://gpluspc.com/) in San Francisco, May 22-23, 2012 at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts. The day before, I attended a photowalk at Golden Gate Park which I [blogged](/2012/05/google-plus-photographers-photowalk-at-golden-gate-park) about already.

Some things I observed and learned at the conference:

* Adobe Lightroom 4, Bridge, and Photoshop seem to be the digital tools of choice of many photographers.
* There are just as many Nikon users as there are Canon users.
* Be a good editor and curator of your work/portfolio. Only show your best work, and when you are ready, organize by a theme.
* When writing Google+ posts, write to share, not to impress.

One of my favorite sessions were the Blind Photo Critiques, where photographers submit a set of photos (two to five pictures) to be critiqued live on stage, in front of everyone on the big screen. I just learned a lot listening to the panel on what makes a good photograph in terms of composition, lighting, focus, and so forth.

I used the [Canon 5D Mark 3](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007FGYZFI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sunpech-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B007FGYZFI)'s HDR feature to take the picture above. I post processed with [Adobe Lightroom 4.1](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html) (RC2). I took about a dozen shots of the bridge, but chose only to show my favorite. Again, editing which was a little difficult.
