title: Pictures from LA Ruby/Rails January Meetup
---

Last night went to the [LA Ruby/Rails Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/laruby/events/40600702/) hosted at [AT&amp;T Interactive](https://www.attinteractive.com). There were two presentations followed by three lightning talks.

* **Using Ruby with R** by Sean Marcia
* **Rack Middleware as a General Purpose Abstraction** by John Bender

Some of the pictures I took are posted below. You can view the picture dump from all pictures I took [here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/ZGMY4vXSLDkCiRMt7.)

As a reminder: [LA RubyConf](https://www.larubyconf.com/) is coming up February 2-4, 2012.
