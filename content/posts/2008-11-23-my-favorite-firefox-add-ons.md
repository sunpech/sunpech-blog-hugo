title: My Favorite Firefox Add-ons
---


[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.com/firefox) is my favorite web browser.  In this day and age, I see no need to use Microsoft's Internet Explorer (IE).  Although I do like [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome), it's still not available for Linux yet.  But this isn't an entry about browsers and the pros and cons of each.  (I do plan on writing about browsers and operating systems in the near future.)

This is the list of add-ons that I install on any computer I use running Firefox.


* [Adblock Plus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865) - Blocks Ads *(a must for anyone serious about web browsing)*
* [Forecastfox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/398) - Weather monitor
* [Delicious Bookmarks](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3615) - Social Bookmarking
* [Fast Dial](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5721) - Nice thumbnail size shortcuts to websites you choose
* [Server Spy](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2036) - Shows what kind of server is running on the page I'm viewing
* [ShowIP](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/590) - Shows the IP address of the site I'm viewing
