title: Installed Ubuntu Linux onto my Thinkpad T60
---


Last weekend I installed [Ubuntu Linux](https://www.ubuntu.com/) onto my Lenovo Thinkpad T60 laptop.  I wanted to keep Windos XP Professional installed, so I chose to dual-boot it using [GRUB](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/).  I also upgraded the 40 GB hard drive to a 250 GB hard drive using a laptop hard drive upgrade kit.  I copied the files over to the new drive, and then installed Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy Heron) in another partition.  It was amazingly simple.

My reason for installing Linux is because I miss it.  Almost ten years ago I got into Linux (Mandrake and Red Hat) in the first place because I was sick of Windows 98.  Win98, which I do not consider an operating system (OS) simply because it does not manage system processes whatsoever.  

What made me sick was that I could not get my work done on it and I truly enjoyed my school's [Solaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_Operating_System) machines (I was an undergrad at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/).  It's been a few years since I truly used Linux for many of my computing needs.  And here I am getting back into that.

Tomorrow, 8.10 will be released and I will again be upgrading my OS.  The picture below is of my system running 8.04.  Notice my G1 next to it.

On the screen I have [Conky](https://conky.sourceforge.net/) running along with [Songbird](https://getsongbird.com/).  You probably can't see it from the angle this was taken.
