title: Finished reading the Groundswell
---


I just finished reading [Groundswell: Winning in a World Transformed by Social Technologies](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422125009?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sunpech-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1422125009). Probably one of the best books I've read this year thus far.

> *What Is Groundswell? It's a book by two Forrester analysts with practical, data-based strategies for companies that want to harness the power of social technologies like blogs, social networks, and YouTube. (source: [Forrester](https://www.forrester.com/Groundswell))*

I absolutely love reading case studies in these IT Business books.  I finished my MS in Information Systems 2 years ago last month.  I'm a little disheartened that I have yet to fully utilize my skillset at my current employment.  But I am currently writing up a paper on how my company can utilize some of these social trends/methodologies and put them to good use internally.

My plan isn't about using any of these technologies/methodologies for the sake of using something cool, but rather from a problem/solution point-of-view.  What is the problem?  What is a potential solution?
