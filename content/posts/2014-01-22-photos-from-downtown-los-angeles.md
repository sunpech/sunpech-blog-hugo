title: Photos from Downtown Los Angeles
---


I'm back in Los Angeles now from traveling to cities like Toronto, San Francisco, and Chicago the past few months. I've been using [500px](https://500px.com) to research nice locations for these photos and it's really paid off-- I'm very happy.

If you haven't noticed, I've been pushing my [500px account](https://500px.com/sunpech) for my photos. I'll have a separate blog post on that soon too, once a print I ordered arrives so I can give it a more thorough review. What I really like is that I get a 35% discount for ordering my own prints, which makes sense since they're mine. But some friends/family have been asking me what print material they should go for-- again, I'll give my thoughts on that in a future blog post.

I recently bought a shutter release remote cable for my DSLR. Specifically, it's the [SMDV Remote Shutter Release Cable](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002KDS2BY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002KDS2BY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=sunpech-20). So far, it's been really good. It holds in place well and does what it's supposed to.

I'm starting to do more long exposures now and and less HDR shots. I'm finding that I like there to be lit and unlit sections to a photo or piece of art. I don't need the dark areas to be super detailed and lit up. That's my quick thought.

Here are my photos:

### Downtown Los Angeles
