This past weekend I attended [BlizzCon](https://www.blizzcon.com/) at the [Anaheim Convention Center](https://www.anaheimconventioncenter.com/). I had a blast taking photos of cosplayers. I must say that [Blizzard](https://www.blizzard.com() fans are some of the most dedicated super fans I've ever met. They love the games, the stories, and are really, *really* into the craft of cosplay. Other than at Anime Expo, these guys have the best cosplay I've ever seen.

This year there was some news on all fronts, minus Warcraft 3 and some other older games of course. The biggest news and events were of the following:

* Warcraft movie is being filmed in Vancouver.
* Diablo 3: Reaper of Souls
* World of Warcraft expansion
* Starcraft II: WCS Finals
* [Heroes of the Storm](https://www.heroesofthestorm.com/en-us) ([MOBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer_online_battle_arena)-game, formerly Blizzard All-Stars and Dota)

The last time I attended BlizzCon [was in 2011](/2011/10/blizzcon-2011). I've been dying to attend for *two years* since last year (2012) they didn't have one. Two years ago, I took photos with my Canon 60D, but was just starting to learn about photography. This year I went in more equipped and knowledgeable with what I wanted to photograph.

I've learned now that *the area outside is the best place for photographers to hang out *to take pictures of cosplayers. The convention floor is just too dark to get the shots that I wanted. A flash is almost necessary.

You may have noticed that I'm putting watermarks in my photos now. I've mentioned before that I don't like watermarks because they make photos, the art, a bit ugly. I'll probably have another blog post covering why I'm going in that direction now.

Anyway, below are some of my favorite pictures. To see more, follow me on [my Facebook photography page](https://www.facebook.com/sunpechphotography).
