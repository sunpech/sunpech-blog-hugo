title: An Android Photoshoot with my new Camera Lens
---


I got my new lens in the mail yesterday.  It's a [Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II Camera Lens](https://www.amazon.com/Canon-50mm-1-8-Camera-Lens/dp/B00007E7JU?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sunpech-20&amp;link_code=btl&amp;camp=213689&amp;creative=392969).

I was studying at the time, but once I got my email notification that it arrived, I rushed to pick it up and did a little photoshoot of my Android toy at the table I was studying at.  I played with the aperture for most of the shoot (in AV mode). Afterwards, I used Adobe Lightroom to polish it up a bit (created a set of Black &amp; White photos too).
