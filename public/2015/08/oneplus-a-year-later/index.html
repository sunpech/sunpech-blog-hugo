<p>I consider the OnePlus One I bought <a href="/2014/08/oneplus-one-vs-nexus-5">over a year ago</a> a value phone&ndash; best phone for the buck you spend. For it&rsquo;s time, it was a big phone, with fantastic specs, for a low price. Even now, it&rsquo;s still a good phone and is my main mobile device. The battery is good and CM12S operating system is also decent.</p>

<p>When I initially had CM11S running on my phone, the battery life was 2 days of regular usage. When I put Lollipop on it, it dropped to about 1.5 days. Still not bad. Even today, I can get through 1-1.5 days of regular usage before I need to recharge. For me, as a non power-user, it&rsquo;s great.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also a bit of a hacker, in that I refuse to wait for any over-the-air (OTA) updates and will manually flash to the latest no matter what. The updates are few and far between, but at least when it&rsquo;s available the community shares the zips and gives a good README on what to do to upgrade the device. But this is rather a compliment to the community than the companies behind the OnePlus One product.</p>

<p>However, it&rsquo;s not all sunshine and rainbows with my OnePlus One (OPO). Outside the actual device hardware, there are things I dislike about the companies and software behind it.</p>

<h3 id="oneplus-and-cyanogen-problems">OnePlus and Cyanogen Problems</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.androidauthority.com/cyanogen-ends-partnership-with-oneplus-604572/">breakup</a> between <a href="https://oneplus.net/">OnePlus</a> and <a href="https://cyngn.com/">Cyanogen</a> over exclusivity in India is a huge letdown. It seems to indicate that Cyanogen is interested in making money over building a good relationship. They like <a href="http://www.androidauthority.com/first-cyanogen-phone-without-google-blu-596283/">talking big</a> about taking over the mobile industry, yet burn the bridges they cross. This is unprofessional and immature. But there are things that haven&rsquo;t been revealed publicly about their relationship that may justify this&ndash; so maybe we should give both companies the benefit of the doubt.</p>

<p>Cyanogen can&rsquo;t keep their word about having an Android port within 90 days (3 months) of a major Android release. When company makes a promise to their fans, they put their name brand on the line. It&rsquo;s better not to give an ETA than to set up paying customers for disappointment. As far as I know, they&rsquo;ve never been able to meet this promise. They are also VC-funded and have taken my money, so it&rsquo;s no longer just open source software.</p>

<p>OnePlus&rsquo;s invite and marketing buzz is rather atrocious. <strong>Their marketing is backwards. You need to deliver a product and make customers happy to get brand loyalty, not ask for it first and then sell customers a product.</strong> The invite system was cute last year, but they&rsquo;re doing it again this year for the <a href="https://oneplus.net/invites?kolid=NN0HB5">OnePlus Two</a>. On top of that, a student developer <a href="https://medium.com/@JakeCooper/so-nice-i-did-it-twice-hacking-the-oneplus-reservation-system-again-2e8226c45f9a">hacked their invite system</a>, twice just to jump the queue. The count of actual individuals interested in their is no where near what is stated.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/screenshot_oneplus_two_invite_count.jpg" alt="OnePlus Two Invite count" /></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s almost as if OnePlus took their marketing plan from <a href="https://youtu.be/crosjxD4XaI">South Park&rsquo;s Cartmanland</a>. Trying to create buzz by showing something interesting, but that most people can&rsquo;t have. Lame.</p>

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>

<p><strong>There&rsquo;s room to disrupt the mobile industry with an inexpensive device that runs custom lightweight Android that is also well supported.</strong> <em>That&rsquo;s what I was hoping both OnePlus and Cyanogen could do together.</em> So far I&rsquo;ve been disappointed with both. One can&rsquo;t figure out how to sell the hardware and is now also jumping into making the software too with <a href="https://forums.oneplus.net/forums/oxygenos/">Oxygen OS</a>. The other talks big and can&rsquo;t deliver the software when promised.</p>

<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m an old fashioned geek here, but I refuse to spend $500+ for a smartphone. For my needs, I&rsquo;d rather get a decked out main laptop (Macbook Pro) where I can do all my computing needs. The smartphone/device is just a consumption device. Yeah sure we have GPS, voice search, and other goodies that&rsquo;s part of the &ldquo;mobile&rdquo; experience, but <strong>my vision of the world is that everything around us will be a mobile device that talks with everything else</strong>&ndash; that compliments what we do on our phone currently. Our cars should all have a GPS and app that detects traffic. Our refrigerator should know when we need to stock up on food/drinks. Our homes should know when open the doors, secure the house, turn on/off the lights, etc. I&rsquo;ve seen people walk around with severely cracked iPhones, and use them to take photos and put up against their face to talk. My guess is that their contract isn&rsquo;t up or they can&rsquo;t simply replace or upgrade their device. I just think that it&rsquo;s wrong for such a commodity to have such control over us.</p>

<p>I still enjoy my OnePlus One phone and <strong>I have no plans to upgrade to a OnePlus Two.</strong> Even if something were to happen to my phone, say I break it, then I would consider the OnePlus Two&ndash; but only if I could get it when I needed it. The level of uncertainty to actually getting the device is ridiculous. I am the master of what I own and buy, not the other way around.</p>

<p>The lack of NFC in the OnePlus Two isn&rsquo;t a deal-breaker for me, and I suspect many people. Maybe in one or two years it&rsquo;ll be a must have for smartphones when it&rsquo;s more widespread in stores. The fingerprint scanner is nice, but also not really a must-have. It&rsquo;s definitely a step in the right direction.</p>

<p>I actually find the <a href="https://www.motorola.com/us/motomaker?pid=FLEXR4&amp;action=designNew#memory">Moto G</a> to be interesting at $220. See: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HDKRP4nzc0">MKBHD&rsquo;s Moto G 2015 Review</a>. This is the phone that is probably every bit worth the price and would be the phone I recommend to friends since they would be able to order it when needed.</p>
