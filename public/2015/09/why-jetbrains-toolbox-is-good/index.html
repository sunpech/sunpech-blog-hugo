<p><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com">Jetbrains</a>, a software company that creates a wealth of software <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">IDE</a>s for software developers recently announced that they are moving their software over to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service">software-as-a-service</a> (SaaS) platform called <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox/">Jetbrains Toolbox</a>.</p>

<p>These are the times we live in now, and I think it&rsquo;s good&ndash; for the most part.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/why_jetbrains_toolbox_is_good.jpg" alt="Jetbrains moving to SaaS" /></p>

<h3 id="buy-or-subscribe">Buy or Subscribe?</h3>

<p>Traditionally, people buy a software version and own it. For many, they don&rsquo;t buy an upgrade when it&rsquo;s available and may only upgrade when money is available or if they feel the new features are worth it.</p>

<p>I once wrote a blog post about <a href="/2015/01/why-i-recommend-adobe-photoshop">Why I recommend Adobe Lightroom</a>. In it I do a quick breakdown of the buy or subscribe payment model. In short, it&rsquo;s worth the subscription if as a user wants the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use both Lightroom and Photoshop.</li>
<li>Really like and use Lightroom a lot.</li>
<li>Really wants Photoshop, but it&rsquo;s really expensive to buy.</li>
</ul>

<p>In Adobe&rsquo;s case, they still offer Adobe Lightroom for purchase&ndash; the Creative Cloud subscription, is just the preferred option they are pushing.</p>

<p><strong>Unfortunately going forward, starting on November 2, 2015, Jetbrains will not offer a buy-to-own model.</strong> Past software purchases will work, but after this date it&rsquo;s the subscription model for everyone. At least for now.</p>

<p>Many of the same reasons will apply for those wondering if the Jetbrains SaaS subscription model is for them or not. Do you use one of Jetbrains products a lot? Is there maybe another Jetbrains product you also use a lot? Do you prefer to get updates often as they become available?</p>

<p>If yes, if you do some number crunching and may see that the subscription model isn&rsquo;t so bad. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with paying for something you like.</p>

<h3 id="why-buying-software-is-going-away">Why buying software is going away</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve purchased my fair share of software over the past eighteen years&ndash; some for personal use, and others for part of my professional workflow. <em>But often times there comes a time when support or the upgrades stop for the software I just bought.</em> This just sucks.</p>

<p>It makes me question why I would ever spend money to own and support software that isn&rsquo;t going to be around for years. This often times puts me in a position to stay on the unlimited free-to-use software (Examples: <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> and <a href="https://plex.tv/">Plex</a>), and regret buying some software (Examples: <a href="https://macromates.com/">Textmate</a> and <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>).</p>

<p>Another pet peeve of mine is the idea of buying a software license for an individual, family, or business. I generally will buy individual at first, then I end up liking it and want to install it on my other computers, but it may well be against the terms of service. I&rsquo;d rather have a more simple affordable payment plan that lets me install and use it however I want. There&rsquo;s only one of me and I generally will use one computer at a time.</p>

<h3 id="why-subscription-model-is-becoming-popular">Why subscription model is becoming popular</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s better for companies to have predictable sales model. If you were a newspaper, would you rather sell your periodical at a newsstand where the sales can vary a lot, or sell yearly/monthly subscriptions to a dedicated customers?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying those who buy off newsstands aren&rsquo;t good customers&ndash; they may not be regular customers.</p>

<p>Another analogy&ndash; if you were a dentist, who would you value more as a client, the one that comes in every other year, sporadically, or the ones that come in every six months for a checkup? I would hope the ones that gives you a more predictable amount of money!</p>

<p>From the perspective of the customer, there should also be an expectation of better service. You&rsquo;re not just a walk-in customer that may or may not return. You&rsquo;re paying good money on a schedule to keep their business going.</p>

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>Unfortunately for me, despite me favoring Jetbrains decision to move to a SaaS model, it doesn&rsquo;t work out for me to be a subscriber. I wrote a whole blog post talking about how good a SaaS model is, yet I won&rsquo;t subscribe to it. That&rsquo;s simply because it&rsquo;s not for me. <strong>Software as a service is popular, but it&rsquo;s certainly not for everyone.</strong></p>

<p>I use <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/">Rubymine</a>, but not often enough to warrant paying for it every month or year. I&rsquo;m currently learning <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a> and I&rsquo;m happy to fall back on <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> or even <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>. These are all free options (well, I technically paid for ST).</p>

<p>Jetbrains Toolbox works out really well for the company and their loyal supporters/subscribers. However if you&rsquo;re like me and don&rsquo;t use the product daily or even weekly, then there may be a reason not to be their customer anymore. And that&rsquo;s fine for me, hopefuly for others like me too because there are other options.</p>

<p><strong>I&rsquo;d like to see Jetbrains offer both purchase and subscription models to their customers.</strong> In some respect, they were already doing that with a yearly renewal based on the purchase date. <em>The target for their subscription model should really be the users that use multiple products. Single product users may be turned off by a subscription model if they don&rsquo;t like or use it enough.</em> At the very least <a href="http://blog.jetbrains.com/blog/2015/09/04/we-are-listening/">they are listening to feedback</a>.</p>

<p><em>This post also reminds me that I&rsquo;m overdue for my visit to the dentist.</em></p>
