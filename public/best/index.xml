      <description>This may be bit more of a weird page. As some of these books aren&amp;rsquo;t exactly business or economics exactly&amp;ndash; or rather purely, but they&amp;rsquo;re books I enjoyed.
Companies and the People I love companies such as Amazon, Zappos, Google, Apple, and the people behind such companies. This list is for these great companies I admire to varying degrees.

      <description>&amp;ldquo;The Best Camera Is The One Thatâ€™s With You&amp;rdquo; - Chase Jarvis
I primarily use and recommend Canon gear, and it&amp;rsquo;s not because I&amp;rsquo;m a Canon fanboy or anti-Nikon&amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s simply because I started with a Canon DSLR and just stuck with that since 2007. If I had started with Nikon, I probably would be using their products.
Anyway, people often ask me for camera recommendations and I honestly don&amp;rsquo;t know what their needs or lifestyle is like to give them a single answer.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve put together a list of my all time favorite comics and graphic novels. I hope you enjoy this list of books I&amp;rsquo;ve read across twenty plus years! I&amp;rsquo;ve organized them by publisher for a more organized look at stuff. For simplicity, I&amp;rsquo;ve categorized the books by publishers since publishers generally represent their own respective universe.
DC Entertainment Since I was little I&amp;rsquo;ve been a fan of both Superman and Batman.</description>

      <description>I fell in love with photography a bit in high school during my junior/senior year. Throughout college I pretty much ignored my artistic side in favore of learning about computers and computer science. In 2010 I started to use my DSLR to once again enjoy the art of photography and story telling.
I put together this list of books I found very influential in my ongoing education on everything regarding photography.</description>
