      <description>Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending a lot of time reading books and watching youTube videos on investing. For years I&amp;rsquo;ve heard a lot about the Robinhood and Acorns apps, but there was nothing about them that made me want to try them out, or move away from my traditional brokerages. It&amp;rsquo;s great that they have mobile apps and free trades for young investors and beginners, but I&amp;rsquo;d rather do my investments carefully on the desktop browser.</description>

      <description>Over the past week I migrated my blog from using static site generator, Jekyll to use Hugo. I also switched hosts from Github Pages to Netlify.
The main reasons for the changes are:
 Jekyll/Ruby is just too slow as a static site generator in development/production. Hugo/Go is fast. Wanted to try out Netlify.  When I wrote new posts with Jekyll, it was painfully slow to build the site after any small set of changes.</description>

      <description>This past weekend I went to Star Wars Celebration in Chicago. This was my first Celebration event I attended so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what to expect. Overall, I&amp;rsquo;d say it was fun and very doable event for its size. What I mean by this is that larger cons like San Diego Comic Con is super fun, but it&amp;rsquo;s also super large where it&amp;rsquo;s not possible to do all the things you want.</description>

      <description>Last weekend I attended C2E2 at Chicago&amp;rsquo;s McCormick Place once again. It&amp;rsquo;a convention I recommend to all my Chicago friends to attend as it&amp;rsquo;s very convenient to attend and is quite affordable since they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to travel far.
If you weren&amp;rsquo;t able to attend, check out SyFy Wire&amp;rsquo;s youTube channel. They have videos of most if not all the panels that happened at C2E2 as well as many other conventions across the US.</description>

      <description>Another year, another Comic Con (SDCC) in the bag!
The programming for this year&amp;rsquo;s Comic Con was different than other years as some of the big studios were not there&amp;ndash; namely Marvel Studios and HBO. I can understand Marvel Studios not being there this year, as they are between the Infinity War movies. They don&amp;rsquo;t want to give much information away in regards to how things are going to be in the coming movies and the next phase of their movie/storytelling development.</description>

      <description>Last weekend I was at Anime Expo (AX). In general it was super fun to be taking photos of cosplayers there again. But it was a crazy hot weekend. It was 100+ &amp;#176; F every day there!
It&amp;rsquo;s been three years (2015) since I was at AX. I mostly hung out inside the South hall again. I didn&amp;rsquo;t see as many cosplayers as I thought I would, and I think that may be because of the heat, and that many notable cosplayers/photographers set up near the Staples Center out West.</description>

      <description>I watched Deadpool 2 over the weekend and I thought the movie was just okay. The movie was done in a Deadpool way, which is both good and bad. This is my review.
Spoilers below of course.
The Good The movie is made for comic fans and those familiar with comic book pop culture. Deadpool&amp;rsquo;s character in the comics and movies is very meta in it&amp;rsquo;s commentary of comics, pop culture, current events.</description>

      <description>Destiny has arrived. I watched the Avengers: Infinity War twice already and I loved it. The first time was the most emotional and suprising, the second time I caught some dialogue I missed and was more relaxed.
It&amp;rsquo;s been over three years since Kevin Feige announced the plans for MCU Phase 3, and ten years since the first movie. This is the culmination of everthing that has come before.</description>

      <description>This year&amp;rsquo;s C2E2 was by far the largest and busiest I&amp;rsquo;ve been to. There seemed to be a bigger space rented out for the event over at McCormick Place. I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother to apply for a press pass this year and just went ahead and bought a 3-day pass. I&amp;rsquo;ve been denied 2 years in a row now and didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like applying&amp;ndash; perhaps next year.
Like many other comic conventions, C2E2 offers mailing of purchased badges if they are bought before a deadline.</description>

      <description>I enjoyed the Black Panther movie. The story, the characters, and especially the villain was well balanced and defined in this Marvel movie. This is my spoilery review.
The Good The characters were really solid. It&amp;rsquo;s an all-star cast!
Letitia Wright is amazing as Black Panther&amp;rsquo;s sister, Shuri. She was having fun and it really showed. She&amp;rsquo;s also starred in an episode of Black Mirror: Black Museum.
Michael B. Jordan knocked it out of the park as Erik Killmonger.</description>

      <description>This looks like a good year for not just comic book fans, but fans of books and other franchises because there are so many sequels coming out. This is why I dropped doing comic book only movies for my posts and opened it up to all movies.
Here are my top 8 movies that I think will be hits:
 Avengers: Infinity War Black Panther Ready Player One Incredibles 2 Ant-Man and The Wasp Deadpool 2 Alita: Battle Angel Venom  Quick Thoughts Black Panther - February 16, 2018.</description>

      <description>I loved Star Wars The Last Jedi. The movie is brilliant. I&amp;rsquo;ve only watched it once as of this posting and I plan on watching it a few more times to catch all the little things I may have missed.
Spoilers below of course.
Empire and Return The movie has similarities to both Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.
The dark tones are similar to Empire. The failure of Luke Skywalker and the entire Jedi Order was touched upon.</description>

      <guid>https://sunpech.com/2017/12/justice-league/</guid>
      <description>I am pretty disappointed in the Justice League (JL) movie. I went in with low expectations since it is a Zack Snyder movie that was finished by Joss Whedon. I&amp;rsquo;ve reviewed Man of Steel and Batman vs Superman where I&amp;rsquo;ve complained about Snyder as a director. Despite Whedon&amp;rsquo;s involvement, JL suffers more of the same&amp;ndash; great visually with unappealing characters and story.
Spoilers below of course.
What I Liked Gal Gadot looks amazing as Wonder Woman.</description>

      <guid>https://sunpech.com/2017/11/thor-ragnarok/</guid>
      <description>I really liked Thor: Ragnarok. By far it was the best Thor movie from the MCU and maybe even the best Marvel movie of 2017. There&amp;rsquo;s not much to complain about in the movie. Spoilers ahead.
What I Liked The movie is a blend of Planet Hulk and Ragnarok story from the comics. Since Marvel can&amp;rsquo;t do Hulk movies&amp;ndash; due to movie rights sitting with Universal, they just incorporated one of his best stories in with Thor&amp;rsquo;s to make a buddy space adventure and comedy movie.</description>

      <description>San Diego Comic Con (SDCC) has come and gone. This year marks my seventh year going to SDCC! Each year I have a good time, but every year it becomes less about the convention floor, offsite experiences, and buying stuff. Going to the con is now more about taking photos and attending panels.
Cosplay I love taking photos of cosplayers, but it&amp;rsquo;s really difficult to be at the right place at the right time to catch some of the awesome cosplay.</description>

      <guid>https://sunpech.com/2017/07/spider-man-homecoming/</guid>
      <description>Spider-Man: Homecoming is a good, coming-of-age movie aimed at younger fans and those young at heart. I liked it on a few levels, but also felt distant because I&amp;rsquo;m older and watched other Spidey and superhero films since the early 1990s.
The Good I like how Tom Holland actually looks like a teenager. I&amp;rsquo;ve always preferred the younger teen Spider-Man that makes quips in battles. Toby Maquire looked too old for high school and Andrew Garfield too handsome/hipster/cool to be Peter Parker.</description>

      <guid>https://sunpech.com/2017/06/wonder-woman/</guid>
      <description>I watched the Wonder Woman movie twice, didn&amp;rsquo;t like it much the first time, but enjoyed it more the second time. My initial reaction after the first viewing was rather harsh on the movie, and I think it had to do with how close I sat and how much my eyes had to travel when looking at the screen. The second time I sat further back in a sweet spot, and my eyes were more relaxed to enjoy the movie.</description>

      <description>Last weekend I was at Anime Central (ACen) which was hosted at the Donald E. Stephens Convention Center. This was my second time attending, and I was also given a press pass again.
I stuck around the main entrance hall/lobby for most of the convention hoping to catch cosplayers on their way in or out of the exhibit hall. It seemed this year a lot of cosplayers were more casual and spent more time in the exhibit hall than the entrance.</description>

      <description>I enjoyed watching Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2, it&amp;rsquo;s what a space adventure movie should be! What I especially love about the movie is that every character has his/her moment in the movie. It&amp;rsquo;s a great sequel to the amazing first movie.
The movie has FIVE post credit scenes, yes 5, so be sure to stay through the entire credit scroll to catch them all. This is my spoiler filled review of the movie, so read no further if you haven&amp;rsquo;t watched the movie yet!</description>

      <description>This past weekend I went to C2E2 over at McCormick Place. Once again I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to obtain a press pass, so I went as a civilian photographer&amp;ndash; I bought my 3-day pass. Every year I&amp;rsquo;m going to try, and every year I&amp;rsquo;m probably going to get denied!
C2E2 isn&amp;rsquo;t too big that it&amp;rsquo;s uncomfortable to go as an individual or even as a family. McCormick Place is huge and there&amp;rsquo;s plenty of room to expand in case the crowd size does ever get bigger.</description>

      <description>I liked the movie, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t love Logan. It was the best Wolverine movie Fox has made, but that bar is rather low to clear. After 17 years of playing the character, it was a good send off for Hugh Jackman. He really made the character his own over the years, despite being different from the comics-Wolverine character.
The Good What I liked about the movie is that it continues to stay true to movie-Wolverine character that Jackman has made in his solo movies.</description>

2017 Rankings This is the ranking, 1-6, ranked from most looking forward to, to least.
 Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (May 5, 2017) Wonder Woman (June 2, 2017) Thor: Ragnarok (November 3, 2017) Justice League (November 17, 2017) Spiderman: Homecoming (July 7, 2017) Logan (March 3, 2017)  Logan I cannot get excited about Fox&amp;rsquo;s Logan.</description>

      <description>The last MCU movie for 2016, Doctor Strange came out last week. This is my spoilery review which covers some plot points and my thoughts of it&amp;rsquo;s potential impact on the movie universe.
I really enjoyed the movie. It was an origin movie that formally introduced magic and the multiverse into Marvel&amp;rsquo;s cinematic universe. This is a big deal because it opens the door to infinite possibilities for how they wish to expand or even link universes together&amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;m looking at Fox&amp;rsquo;s Deadpool/X-Men franchise here.</description>

      <description>My quick non-spoiler-y thoughts on Suicide Squad:
I went in with low expectations, overall, the movie was just okay. I was entertained, but not blown away by anything. If you are expecting what you saw the trailers, you are probably going to be disappointed. It&amp;rsquo;s worth a watch if you want to keep up with the DC movie universe.
Disclaimer: I watched the movie for free with my T-Mobile Tuesday App, which gave me free tickets.</description>

      <description>Just got back from San Diego Comic Con and I&amp;rsquo;m super exhausted! My sisters and I were lucky this year and we got rooms at the Manchester Grand Hyatt, just a few blocks away from the convention center. I even nabbed myself a Superman Conan FunkoPop that was being raffled away in the very same hotel we were staying at!
The weather was hot as the sun was unforgiving most of the time during the day.</description>

I normally give a spoiler warning, but I won&amp;rsquo;t say enough about the plot of the movie to ruin anyone&amp;rsquo;s experience. But in case you are sensitive to any information and want to go in fresh, then you should stop reading now&amp;ndash; but I doubt that since you&amp;rsquo;ve read this far already.
I do have some background in playing Warcraft III, World of Warcraft (WoW), Hearthstone, and other games from Blizzard Entertainment.</description>

      <description>This is my spoiler filled review for the latest X-Men movie. I also talk about all the previous X-Men movies. It won&amp;rsquo;t be pretty.
I did not care for X-Men: Apocalypse.
I went in with low expectations and came out disappointed with what I saw. This is coming from someone who read some of the X-Men comics as well as watched the 1990s animated TV series.
The problem is it&amp;rsquo;s a movie where things happen, has characters from the X-Men universe, but in name only.</description>

      <description>This past weekend I attended Anime Central, also known as ACen. I was given a press pass and attended all three days, May 20-22nd. My main goal was to take photos of cosplayers in and out of the Donald E. Stephens Convention Center. ACen is the Midwest&amp;rsquo;s largest anime, manga, and Japanese pop culture convention. It&amp;rsquo;s the third largest anime convention, but in recent news I&amp;rsquo;ve heard it&amp;rsquo;s the second now, behind Anime Expo (AX).</description>

      <description>This is my Captain America: Civil War review that contains spoilers, so if you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the movie yet, please stop reading now! I also provide some insights and predictions on what&amp;rsquo;s to come. I also assume you&amp;rsquo;ve seen all the movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) to date.
I&amp;rsquo;ve watched the movie twice now and I really like it. I even enjoyed it more the second time. Not only does it complete a trilogy of the Captain America movies, it also sets up Phase 3 of the MCU.</description>

      <description>I recently finished reading Console Wars by Blake J. Harris and I really enjoyed the trip down memory lane. I grew up in the 1980s and 1990s and played on video game systems by Nintendo, Sega, Sony, and Atari. This is my reflection on this gaming era after reading this book.
Console Wars tells the story of Tom Kalinske, an American business man and CEO behind Sega of America during its meteoric rise and fall.</description>

      <description>Over the weekend I saw Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. In a nutshell, I thought it was okay, but not great&amp;ndash; nor does it match the hype. This post does contain SPOILERS, so don&amp;rsquo;t read any further if you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it yet or don&amp;rsquo;t mind!

Friday The main purpose of Day 1 was to pick up my lanyard, get a lay of the land, walk the exhibit hall, and determine whether I would be permitted to take photos from different positions in the main stage.</description>

There are so many movies coming out from both Marvel and DC that it&amp;rsquo;s a stark reminder how great it is to be a fan. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, this post is spoiler free for both the movies (since I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen them nor have they come out yet) and the source materials, the comics.</description>

      <description>A few days ago my niece visited Chicago for the first time and I took her around to see and eat some of the best my city has to offer. Although I&amp;rsquo;ve visited John Hancock Observatory before, I haven&amp;rsquo;t been up to Willis Tower (specifically the Skydeck) since it was called the Sears Tower.
The challenge with taking photos at these locations was that we went up right after it rained and there were a lot of cloud/fog surrounding Chicago.</description>

      <description>With Black Friday and Cyber Monday behind us and the upcoming holidays upon us, some of you may be getting a new external hard drive(s) for your Mac or Windows system(s). I wanted to write up a guide on how to format your drive into exFAT, the format that is well supported and ideal for many cases.
The Benefits of exFAT A few years ago, I wrote about how hard drives marketed to Apple devices are over-priced and are functionally the same as their Windows counterpart.</description>

      <description>On Sunday I went to checkout Open House Chicago and did a little photowalk of my own. I actually had no plan to go until my sister gave me her priority pass the morning of. But I&amp;rsquo;m glad I did as it was not only had some good photops, but was a nice steps in too since I use FitBit.
The places I visited:
 The Oriental Theatre Joffrey Ballet Aon Center Continental Illinois Bank Building The Rookery  My favorite spot was the Aon Center.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I was in Chicago with hopes of getting some nice photos of Chicago henge&amp;ndash; basically the fall equinox where the sunset lines up straight with the East-West street grid. But there were some clouds in the sky which prevented any starburst from happening. However, I went early enough to do some exploring around downtown for other fun shots.
In particular I hopped on the CTA and looked for some train shots on the &amp;lsquo;L&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, Apple had their livestream event (September 9, 2015) announcing a bunch of new things. As usual, I live tweeted some of my thoughts during the keynote. For the most part, my tweets are meant to poke fun at everything and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be taken in the most serious context. I say this because some contacts I have take great personal insult whenever I poke fun of big successful companies like Apple&amp;ndash; that are named Apple.</description>

      <description>Jetbrains, a software company that creates a wealth of software IDEs for software developers recently announced that they are moving their software over to a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform called Jetbrains Toolbox.
These are the times we live in now, and I think it&amp;rsquo;s good&amp;ndash; for the most part.

      <description>I had some spare time before dinner near Navy Pier to take some pictures of the Chicago River off Lake Shore Drive. I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to take photos at this location, but never was in the area during the right time. I had about a forty minutes during sunset to grab some shots and then run off to dinner.
This was my favorite shot I took.
There were some challenges to getting this photo.</description>

      <description>I enjoyed reading Andy Weir&amp;rsquo;s book, The Martian. It reads mostly like a series of journal entries of the protagonist, Mark Watney who&amp;rsquo;s stuck on Mars. If you are a science buff, there&amp;rsquo;s some interesting things that occur in terms of problem solving which Mythbuster Adam Savage, has said he would love to try at his Comic Con panel.
It&amp;rsquo;s also a quick read, as you may find yourself flying through the chapters as they are a bit short.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I went to Trey Ratcliff&amp;rsquo;s Chicago Photowalk. I had fun walking from the Adler Planetarium toward the Bean. As usual on my many photowalks, I tend to stray from the large groups and do my own thing. I just find it difficult to get shots I want around dozens or in this case hundreds of other photographers.
This event was actually my second time that I met Trey. The first time was a few years ago at a Santa Monica Photowalk along with MySpace Tom.</description>

      <description>A few months ago I read Ernest Cline&amp;rsquo;s book, Ready Player One. I blogged about my love for the book and how excited I was that a movie was being made. Quick update, it&amp;rsquo;s getting a release date of December 15, 2017! However, I can&amp;rsquo;t say that I liked his second book, Armada, nearly as much.
In a nutshell the book is The Last Starfigther meets Ender&amp;rsquo;s Game. It&amp;rsquo;s a coming of age story of a teenager that plays video games, struggles with his place in the world, and has pop culture knowledge of things from the 80s forward.</description>

      <description>I consider the OnePlus One I bought over a year ago a value phone&amp;ndash; best phone for the buck you spend. For it&amp;rsquo;s time, it was a big phone, with fantastic specs, for a low price. Even now, it&amp;rsquo;s still a good phone and is my main mobile device. The battery is good and CM12S operating system is also decent.
When I initially had CM11S running on my phone, the battery life was 2 days of regular usage.</description>

      <description>A couple nights ago I was in downtown Chicago for a meetup at Chicago Ruby. Since I found cheap parking via Parking Panda, I figured afterwards I would spend a little time taking some photos of the famous Chicago Theatre.
The challenge of taking the photo at this location at night was that there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of people and cars moving or idling on both sides of the street. On top of that, to my left was a camera crew filming what I assume to be something for either a TV show or commercial.</description>

Like previous years, I attend AX mostly to take pictures of cosplays in the South Hall. Not many people realize that the lighting from the windows and structure of the building acts like a diffuser for most of the day. In other words, it makes LA&amp;rsquo;s harsh light into something fun to work with.</description>

I don&amp;rsquo;t hold it against them for not getting an email right away. I found out about the issue from social media&amp;ndash; basically word-of-mouth. Which to be honest, I&amp;rsquo;m fine with. I&amp;rsquo;m just glad that when there is a problem that Internet people bring it up and share it right away.</description>

This post is spoiler-free. Read it knowing that you can still fully enjoy the book and upcoming movie.
The Book The book paints a picture of a dystopian future, the year 2044, where people are plugged away in a virtual reality based world, OASIS.</description>

For the time it was released, I would say the published book collected the most information on Steve Jobs out there. Isaacson generally gives a negative review of Jobs with multiple repetitions of reality distortion field throughout the book. The book focuses a little more on the bad relationships than the good ones.</description>

      <description>There are two tech TV shows that I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying right now: Silicon Valley and Halt and Catch Fire.
They both deal with the business and culture of technology startups, but yet are pretty different from each other. They are both on their second seasons.
Silicon Valley pokes fun at the today&amp;rsquo;s tech craze in a humorous and ridiculous way. As it should be, technology is hot stuff right now and there&amp;rsquo;s so much money being thrown around as everyone thinks they are going to change the world with their product.</description>

      <description>Are you a fan of Game of Thrones like I am? Have you checked out Comic Book Girl 19&amp;rsquo;s (CBG19) youTube videos on this book/show?
Well, you should. Her epic history videos cover all the major houses (Baratheon, Stark, Targaryen, and Lannister). She has other videos too.
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read the books like me, her videos helps me appreciate the TV show immensely. I previously blogged about my Top 5 YouTube Channels for Comic Geeks, and she&amp;rsquo;s listed there as being one of my favorites.</description>

      <description>I recently made the move from Blogger to Jekyll, hosted on Github Pages. It was a pretty pleasant conversion too, as Jekyll has a good amount of documenation and support.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had a blog since 1999. I&amp;rsquo;ve used just about every known blogging technology/platform out there. I&amp;rsquo;ve used perl, php, mysql, ASP, MS Access, ASP.NET, C#, MS SQL, Postgres, Ruby on Rails, Heroku, Apache Web Server, IIS, etc to write my own blogging software.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s such an amazing time to be a comic book fan/geek. From movies to TV shows and merchandising, all the way to comic cons, there&amp;rsquo;s just so much content to consume that it can be a bit overwhelming. I don&amp;rsquo;t really watch TV anymore and just rely on my social media feed, websites, and youTube for all my news and entertainment. So there are a few YouTube channels that I absolutely love and would recommend to my friends and comic fans alike.</description>

      <description>This past Sunday I went to check out Chicago&amp;rsquo;s very own C2E2 at McCormick Place. I only went for one day unfortunately, but I had a good time walking the floor and taking pictures here and there. I really do find this con to be better than Wizard World Chicago. Not only is it bigger, with room to expand at McCormick, but the fans and cosplayers were in abundance. In short, it was way more fun.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using OS X as my main OS for almost five years now. But one thing that&amp;rsquo;s bugged me for a while was the lack of support for Logitech and other mice&amp;rsquo;s forward and back buttons. These are mouse shortcut buttons found on many gaming mice. As much as I enjoy Apple&amp;rsquo;s trackpad, I still like to use the mouse for gaming and other things.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a picture of my mouse with the buttons that under Windows, normally maps to forward and back in the web browser.</description>

      <description>This past Friday the Chicago Humanities Festival had Scott McCloud at the Art Institute. Not many of my friends and family know that Mr. McCloud was a big influence during my teenage and high school years.
Back in the nineties, I was a big comic book reader. Besides being a reader, I also loved doodling and drawing. But after a while, I wanted to know more about the history, art, and motivations of the comic book creators.</description>

      <description>Over the past few years, friends have been asked me photography questions in terms of camera gear and software. Perhaps I&amp;rsquo;ll write a post in the future on physical camera gear, but for this post I wanted to cover why I love using Adobe Photoshop Lightroom and why you should consider it for your photo needs.
Adobe Lightroom is essentially a trimmed down version of Photoshop (PS) with features built in for a Photography workflow.</description>

Some goals:  I recently upgraded my SLR Lounge Presets to V6 and look forward to using their system in upcoming projects. Now that I&amp;rsquo;m back in Chicago, I hope to do some more street photos of the great city!</description>

      <description>Last week I drove from Los Angeles back to my hometown of Chicago. I&amp;rsquo;ve moved back home for personal reasons. It took my sister and I nine days to get across the US&amp;ndash; mostly just eating, driving, sleeping, and taking pictures.
The states I drove through were (in order):
 California Arizona Utah Colorado Kansas Missouri Illinois  
The first half of the trip from California to Colorado was rather scenic and interesting.</description>

The exhibit runs from May 23, 2014 to May 31, 2015.
Below is the photo I took at SDCC in 2013 that they used. It&amp;rsquo;s taken on the escalators leading up to the ticket booths.</description>

      <description>I attended my third Comikaze Expo (CE) over the weekend, October 31st through November 2nd. I had a great time again. I say this every year&amp;ndash; Comikaze keeps getting bigger and better. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what the numbers are, but the attendance on Saturday was pretty big&amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;d say probably a 30% increase from last year.
I only went on Friday and Saturday. I did go on Thursday to do an early pick up of my badge&amp;ndash; which is where and when I took the shot below of the Los Angeles Convention Center with the Comikaze Expo sign.</description>

What I enjoyed about LBCC is that it&amp;rsquo;s a small con without the hassle of a big convention like San Diego Comic Con.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago my SmugMug account expired and I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother to renew it. This is where my photography website, Sunpech Photography, used to be hosted. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t fully utilizing it to make sales nor was I pushing it very much to friends, family, and even clients. So I couldn&amp;rsquo;t justify spending any money on it when I&amp;rsquo;d rather make sales on 500px and 500px Art.
Surprisingly my account was discontinued almost immediately and I whipped up a decent site in less than 24 hours along with appropriate DNS changes just so I didn&amp;rsquo;t have an ugly 404 page.</description>

      <description>Last month in July, I purchased two Android phones: The Nexus 5 (N5) and the OnePlus One (OPO). I initially ordered the Nexus 5 because I was sick of waiting for an OnePlus invite that I signed up for in April. Up until then, I was using a Galaxy Nexus for two years and its overall performance was rather sluggish and could no longer hold a charge for half a day.</description>

      <description>I like Twitter for following interesting people and entities. But lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve taken to Instagram more because it can also be interesting and more visually pleasing since each post has a picture telling a story.
I know Twitter has updated features to display images in web and mobile apps now, but most tweets do not have any picture whatsoever&amp;ndash; even though tweets with pictures have twice the amount of engagements over those that do not have a picture.</description>

      <description>I really like the city of San Diego. It&amp;rsquo;s a very clean city with little to no smog in the air, unlike Los Angeles.
I was there for Comic Con a few days early last week. So I put aside some time to go take pictures of the skyline from Coronado Island. I did a little research on 500px and picked a spot that had a clear shot of the skyline.</description>

This visit marks my fourth visit to San Diego&amp;rsquo;s Comic Con, with next year (2015) marking twenty years since I attended my first comic con in Chicago. I cannot believe it&amp;rsquo;s been that long since I first ventured into a convention

This year I didn&amp;rsquo;t take as many pictures as I did in previous years. I think it&amp;rsquo;s mostly because I&amp;rsquo;m more interested in attending panels and enjoying myself.</description>

I bought them with the intention of giving them to my sisters since we all use the Line chat app. But on the way back to the US, I had an eight hour layover at the Incheon International airport in South Korea. I happened to pack the toys in my carry-on so I took them out to have a little photo shoot.</description>

In today&amp;rsquo;s times we should all be capturing everything in digital format already. From DSLRs, HD camcorders, to even our smartphones. We just need a way to bring the past thirty plus years of our lives into the modern age.</description>

The episode covered part of the cosplay competition at Stan Lee&amp;rsquo;s Comikaze Expo. I was there in attendance checking out the event and taking photos of many cosplayers and panels.
I appear at about the 2:34 mark as the opening credits are still rolling.

      <description>When I design websites and always wonder what the site would look like on different screen resolutions. I don&amp;rsquo;t always have all the devices to test the layout on, so I generally will prefer to resize my browser window. I once had a wallpaper that had different screen resolutions marked out, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find it or google it. So I decided to make my own.
I joined Pixelapse.com and made a desktop wallpaper project.</description>

Below are some photos from two separate orders I made. The packaging is really well done, and they consolidated two prints into one big box.

      <description>The 6th St. bridge has a magnificent view of the Los Angeles skyline. There&amp;rsquo;s only a two problems about getting the photo at this location.
First, the area in the Arts district isn&amp;rsquo;t so good. There&amp;rsquo;s little foot traffic and I don&amp;rsquo;t feel comfortable bringing expensive equipment to set up there. Second, there are telephone wires running across in the view. I had to use Photoshop to clean that all up.</description>

      <description>One evening I took my DSLR and a bokeh kit with a heart-shaped cut out and took a walk down Miracle Mile. I started at LACMA and just walked east on Wilshire and snapped away at all the lights and traffic. I didn&amp;rsquo;t care so much about ISO as I needed to take fast shots of varying lighting situations that came up on the street&amp;ndash; so I just stayed in auto-ISO.</description>

      <description>I use 500px to do research on where I want to go take pictures and what kind of shots to do. One in particular compelled me to go to Griffith Park to get a shot of the Griffith Observatory as well as LA&amp;rsquo;s skyline.

      <description>I have an old Western Digital Elements External USB HDD&amp;nbsp;(3TB)&amp;nbsp;that that mostly sits on my shelf since I&amp;rsquo;ve moved my data onto a formal network area storage (NAS). After doing some research, it turns out that these external USB hard drives actually have full 3.5&amp;rdquo; SATA hard drive inside! All you need to do is pry open the back with a knife or flathead screwdriver and remove the hard drive, and remove the USB adapter.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m back in Los Angeles now from traveling to cities like Toronto, San Francisco, and Chicago the past few months. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using 500px to research nice locations for these photos and it&amp;rsquo;s really paid off&amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;m very happy.
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t noticed, I&amp;rsquo;ve been pushing my 500px account for my photos. I&amp;rsquo;ll have a separate blog post on that soon too, once a print I ordered arrives so I can give it a more thorough review.</description>

      <description>This is my last of three posts covering the three landmarks I visited in Chicago during this past winter. My first was of Chicago&amp;rsquo;s John Hancock Observatory and the other was of Chicago&amp;rsquo;s Bean.
The last landmark I visited was of a sunset from Chicago&amp;rsquo;s Adler Planetarium. I visited the Adler before and took pictures there&amp;ndash; but this was all when I first started to get into some HDR and photography.</description>

      <description>I was in Chicago for nearly three weeks during the holidays. I only planned to be there with my parents/family for about two weeks, but the snow, friends, and family all kept me from leaving&amp;ndash; so I ended up rebooking my flight TWICE.
During my extensive stay in Chicago, I visited a few landmarks to take some pictures.
I wrote a blog post covering my photos from John Hancock Observatory already.</description>

      <description>I was up in San Francisco in late November and early December last year. It was a very last minute trip, but one I wanted to do for such a long time. I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to get some shots of the iconic Golden Gate Bridge in SF&amp;ndash; without any fog. My prior visits have always been foggy and I could never see the full bridge.
Well, this trip was somewhat dedicated to visiting the bridge several times to get some shots&amp;ndash; to which I was finally able to get some shots without fog.</description>

      <description>Last year I did some traveling in October and November. In late October, I went to Toronto for the first time. The city is beautiful there. I&amp;rsquo;ve probably been in Los Angeles too long, but I noticed how clear the skies were and was astonished to look at buildings with no haze in front. It really showcases how LA is such a polluted and dirty city.
While I was there I got a chance to see Ai Weiwei&amp;rsquo;s Forever Bicycle exhibit.</description>

      <description>Last night I went to visit the John Hancock Observatory with my sister. The last time I was there was in 2006 I think, somewhat a long time ago. I recall the views from JH being far superior to those from the Sears tower&amp;ndash; now called Willis tower. Plus I&amp;rsquo;ve seen some pictures on 500px taken from JH and wanted to try my hand at those views.

      <description>This past weekend I attended BlizzCon at the Anaheim Convention Center. I had a blast taking photos of cosplayers. I must say that Blizzard fans are some of the most dedicated super fans I&amp;rsquo;ve ever met. They love the games, the stories, and are really, really into the craft of cosplay. Other than at Anime Expo, these guys have the best cosplay I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen.
This year there was some news on all fronts, minus Warcraft 3 and some other older games of course.</description>

      <description>This past weekend I went to Comikaze Expo at the Los Angeles Convention Center. Last year I blogged about my experience and I must say that this year is a huge improvement. I want to share with everyone my thoughts and pictures I took of the convention.
But first I want to say that what Comikaze is doing is important. San Diego Comic Con (SDCC) is getting so big now that many comics/sci-fi/horror fans can&amp;rsquo;t even get tickets or housing to the huge event&amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s such a hassle!</description>

      <description>Last night I went to my second Drink and Click LA meetup in downtown Artwalk. Specifically we checked out The Last Bookstore, which is an amazing place to walk around and take photos if you are into books and little trinkets. Generally they ask you to check your bag at what I think is their main entrance, but the other entrance they do not in case you want to bring your camera bag in, which is what we all did.</description>

      <description>There are so many cloud storage services out there now vying for our attention and data. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share my thoughts on the popular choices out there. I&amp;rsquo;m only looking at the personal or free plans. I&amp;rsquo;m leaving out anything for businesses or enterprises&amp;ndash; those are just a different beast with very different needs altogether.
Things I try to consider:
 Size of free storage (either from the start or earned through referrals) Sharing and collaboration on files Ease of use Anything else more than storage  Amazon Cloud Drive I really do not use this service.</description>

      <description>Man of Steel is the best take on Superman movie since Christopher Reeve donned the role. For me, he set the bar as to what Superman was before anything. Immediately after watching the movie, I said I liked it. But after sleeping on it and thinking about it more and more, I&amp;rsquo;ve come to like it less and less.
SPOILERS below. You have been warned.
What I liked: It&amp;rsquo;s a new take on Superman.</description>

      <description>Buying any technology related products online is still by far the best way to save money over buying from traditional brick and mortar stores. The likely products you would buy for your PC/Mac are keyboards, mice, external hard drive, and headphones.
I&amp;rsquo;d like to focus on the external hard drives, since they are currently priced differently between the PC and Mac market. For all intents and purposes of these drives are to backup data of a machine running either Windows or Mac.</description>

      <description>For the past seven months I&amp;rsquo;ve jumped back into reading comics and graphic novels. I used to read them a lot when I was a teenager, but just lost interest by the mid/late 1990s. I find myself struggling to enjoy reading monthly issues and going to the comic book shop every week&amp;ndash; or even getting them online via Comixology.
The problem I have is that I don&amp;rsquo;t like reading them month to month&amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s too little to read bit by bit.</description>

Get a 2-3 year warranty for your laptop.
In 2001, I got my first laptop&amp;ndash; a Dell Latitude C600 (15&amp;rdquo; screen). Over my years using this as my main PC, the screen, hard drive, and battery all broke at some point.</description>

      <description>In Feedly, there&amp;rsquo;s a Flickr group that I subscribe to: What&amp;rsquo;s in your camera bag? I like to consider it photography gear porn.
So I thought I would share what I typically carry with me when I&amp;rsquo;m out and about. I consider this a light package. When I&amp;rsquo;m actually at an event I know I will take tons of pictures, there will be a bit more in my bag. But overall, this is good enough for most situations.</description>

The ticket for Sunday was only $10. Not bad, but they didn&amp;rsquo;t have long hours on this Easter Sunday. However, they did open the doors early for everyone. Supposedly it said 11am, but they let people in as early as 10am.</description>

Why? As The Next Web wrote, Former Google Reader product manager confirms our suspicions: Its demise is all about Google+. See Brian Shih, former Google Reader Product Manager&amp;rsquo;s answer on Quora.
This is sad for me because other than Gmail and Search itself, Google Reader (GR) is the service I use the most from Google, and is a browser tab I always have open.</description>

      <description>I went to the The UnCubed event here in Los Angeles this past Thursday. I wanted to check out what startups are here in LA and see the panels. It was good event that was extremely relaxed for a job fair. It was right by the beach&amp;ndash; LA style no doubt.
I took pictures here and there, but didn&amp;rsquo;t take any of the actual job fair. I got a chance to see what companies and technologies are at play.</description>

      <description>Today I checked out the Stanley Kubrick Exhibit at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA). To be honest, I&amp;rsquo;m not all too familiar with Stanley Kubrick&amp;rsquo;s work. There are only two of his movies that I can say I watched entirely: Eyes Wide Shut and A.I. Artificial Intelligence. The latter being more Spielberg than Kubrick anyway.
I hear that a lot of people either really like Kubrick&amp;rsquo;s films, or really dislike them.</description>

      <description>A week ago I deleted my Instagram and Path accounts.
Today I was able to delete an old Facebook account I created in 2006 when I was in graduate school. After graduating, I not only lost access to that email address, but also forgot the password and even the email address! It was one of those school accounts that auto generates an email address based on first letter of first name, followed by however many more characters of the last name.</description>

      <description>Over the weekend on Sunday, I went to check out the Dark Knight Legend Exhibit at LA Live. It&amp;rsquo;s a free exhibit there, located on the top of the parking structure just north of LA Live. The exhibit runs until December 14, 2012.
There&amp;rsquo;s artwork, vehicles, models, props, costumes, and behind the scene videos from all the Batman films throughout the exhibit. I really like how close I could get to the props and costumes.</description>

The Problem I got the following error message:

That of course worked for me, but when it came time to having Visual Studio 2012 (VS2012) and running an emulator for Windows Phone 8, it simply doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. I searched the Internet as to why, and came up with the following links:

      <description>Over the weekend I attended Long Beach Comic Con held at the Long Beach Convention Center. It&amp;rsquo;s not as big as San Diego Comic Con nor Comikaze Expo, but it definitely had a more collector&amp;rsquo;s paradise feel to it.
I actually didn&amp;rsquo;t take too many pictures myself as I was head deep in the comic book bins looking for deals on actual comic books. Normally I&amp;rsquo;m more of a trade paperback (TPB) kind of comic reader, but recently started picking up some individual titles again.</description>

I had already tried Windows 8 Preview as well as have Windows 7 Ultimate running as a virtual machines (VMs) through Parallels Desktop on my Macbook Pro (MBP). I didn&amp;rsquo;t like the preview edition that much, so I uninstalled it after a few days. But after attending the event, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d give it another look.</description>

The directions you find in this blog post, you should easily be able to find using a search engine. I just want to document what I did, hoping to help fill the Internet with something useful, maybe.
The didn&amp;rsquo;t have a problem with the CPU or even memory. Well, I do constantly run out of HDD space every two-three months, but I do regular backups to an external USB 3.</description>

      <description>I picked up a free ticket to Mobile Camp LA earlier this week and decided to attend. Overall I wasn&amp;rsquo;t too impressed with the event. It may have very well been the first of it&amp;rsquo;s kind aimed at developers, designers, and business folk. Anyway, I thought the venue was a bit of a mess as many things went wrong.  Earthquake drill at 10:15am (slightly distracting, but out of their control&amp;ndash; I understand) A lot of sessions held in a one big open space separated by cloth dividers.</description>

Like the one I went to earlier this year, this one was also a bit heavy on the .Net side of technology with little representation from Android and iOS, and nothing from Ruby/Rails/Java/etc.</description>

As far as I know, this was the first &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; comic con taking place in Los Angeles. The previous year&amp;rsquo;s I heard took place in a parking structure or something. But this is a comic con for LA made by fans, for fans. That&amp;rsquo;s their slogan more or less anyway.
Anyway, I had fun and took a lot of pictures.</description>

What I loved was that the costumes and culture were so colorful and lively. Pretty much everyone was enjoying themselves watching or dancing along to a nice big neighborhood party.
The parade was pretty awesome too. I just wish the sidewalk for it was a bit bigger and less congested.</description>

On Friday there was LA Greekfest. I went during the evening to avoid the crowd and heat during the day. My favorite dish was the dessert, the pastry puffs.

I took quite a few photos, but only post-processed a fraction of them. I may choose to post-process more of them at a later date. You can view the full album here.
I attended SDCC with a 4-day pass along with preview night.</description>

The last time I attended AX was in 2008, quite a long time ago. I recall being the odd one for not dressing up&amp;ndash; as so so very many people dress up in an anime costume!
So a motivation for attending this year was to take pictures of the costumed attendees.</description>

      <description>After seeing the Nexus 7 tablet make its debut at Google I/O yesterday, it made me realize how my Kindle Fire (KF) is kind of lame. I reviewed the Kindle Fire back in November 2011.

To be fair though, my needs have changed. When I initially purchased the KF, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want an iPad2 or a 10&amp;rdquo; tablet. I just wanted a simple reading device that could browse the web a bit and play some games.</description>

Some things I observed and learned at the conference:
 Adobe Lightroom 4, Bridge, and Photoshop seem to be the digital tools of choice of many photographers. There are just as many Nikon users as there are Canon users.</description>

The photowalk was pretty fun. It&amp;rsquo;s the third photowalk I&amp;rsquo;ve been on so far, and in general I like to stray from the group, go at my own pace, and take shots of everything I find interesting.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been to a few coworking offices in LA already (CoLoft, BlankSpaces, and Kleverdog), and I can honestly say that this is my favorite to cowork in. One, it&amp;rsquo;s conveniently located in Culver City, where I currently live in. Two, it&amp;rsquo;s got a great amount of space, offices, and little nooks to work in.</description>

I will most likely make my way up there for that&amp;ndash; about eighty-percent sure I&amp;rsquo;ll go.
I plan to take my photography gear to take plenty of pictures too!</description>

Say hello to the Canon 70-200mm f/2.8 L IS II lense and Canon 5D Mark III! Yes, after a few weeks after the Canon 5DM3 announcement, I decided to go ahead and make the purchase. It cost an arm and a leg, but now I no longer have to watch videos of other people unboxing and reviewing these products, I get to use them myself!</description>

So here&amp;rsquo;s a list of what&amp;rsquo;s in my setup:
WD TV Live Streaming Media Player This is the heart of the Home Theatre PC (HTPC).

WD Elements 3 TB USB 2.0 Desktop External Hard Drive I don&amp;rsquo;t recommend attaching more than one external hard drive via a USB hub.</description>

      <description>This past weekend, on Sunday April 1, 2012, I went to LA&amp;rsquo;s Thaitown to check out the Songkran (Thai New Year) celebrations along Hollywood Blvd. They closed Hollywood off from Western all the way to Normandie to have a street festival/parade. I arrived around 11am and spent about 30 minutes just trying to find parking. I ran along Hollywood just in time to catch the beginning of the parade.</description>

      <description>Over the weekend I was in Chicago. I woke up early the morning following St. Patrick&amp;rsquo;s Day to take some photos near the Adler Planetarium and Millennium Park. I got there with my sister just before sunrise around 6:30am.
The tools I used: Canon 60D&amp;nbsp;camera body with Canon 16-35mm L wide lens&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;Canon 24-105mm L lens&amp;nbsp;along with my tripod. For post processing: Apple&amp;rsquo;s Aperture and Photomatix Pro.

      <description>Last night I attended the Light Chasers Artwalk Downtown meetup. I arrived early and walked to the Walt Disney Concert Hall to do some HDR shots. Upon arriving there, I immediately regretted not bringing my 16-35mm f/2.8 L lens. So made due with my recently purchased 24-105 f/4 L lens, which I really haven&amp;rsquo;t used that much yet.
I spent most of the evening on my own going at my own pace to take pictures.</description>

      <description>The Canon 5D Mark 3 was announced yesterday.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking to get a full-frame DSLR for a while now. Last year I was thinking of getting the Canon 5D Mark 2 (M2), but settled for the Canon 60D because of price and I&amp;rsquo;d rather wait for the M3. Hopefully the M2 will drop in price slightly once the M3 officially comes out.
The price of the M3 is $3500. That&amp;rsquo;s body only, no kit lens.</description>

      <description>The Design of Everyday Things comes highly recommended on Coding Horror&amp;rsquo;s recommended reading list as well as many other software developers. After giving it a read, I thought it was good, relevant today, but slightly dated with their examples.
After reading the book, I am reminded of the light switch to my bathroom in my current apartment in Los Angeles. See below.
It&amp;rsquo;s such a horrible design! The left-most button, which is red, is for off.</description>

I had a great time seeing and learning how other photography enthusiasts and professionals see things. I brought my Canon 60D, Canon 16-35mm L lens, and tripod. I regret not bringing another lens with me for some more flexibility.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve become a Meetup Junkie. Every month I attend several meetups related to technology and food. I can&amp;rsquo;t seem to get enough of following these interests with other like-minded individuals, in the real world.

I primarily use Meetup to find interesting groups by city. I&amp;rsquo;ve used it in Chicago, Bangkok, San Francisco, and now Los Angeles. It&amp;rsquo;s fantastic and addicting!
But for those who haven&amp;rsquo;t used such a service, it may be somewhat scary&amp;ndash; especially if you are an introvert.</description>

Anand &amp;ldquo;Kumi&amp;rdquo; Nandakumar (@kumi360) presented MongoDB + Node.js design decisions for Jumpspoon. Nuri Halperin presented MongoDB vs. RDBMS.
Overall a good group. I look forward to attend future meetups and learn more about how mongodb is being used.

      <description>Microsoft has a new logo design for their operating system (OS), Windows. I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a few tech bloggers/writers reactions to it lately, and I felt I just had to add my two bits in.
The last time I did a blog post on logo design, was on Tropicana&amp;rsquo;s new logo design.
MG Siegler&amp;rsquo;s recent blog post on Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s new logo evolution was the first ones I read. Other writers have also written how the new logo is no longer wavy and flag-like.</description>

The room was primarily designers, which is a nice change for me, as I generally go to developer-centric meetups and events. I hope to be more of a dev-signer (developer/designer).
Here are some of the pictures I took. As usual, you can find the album where I dump all my meetups pictures for this year here.</description>

The documentary is wonderful! Besides the very appealing video of sushi on the big screen, there is quite a story of Jiro Ono and his sushi restaurant, Sukiyabashi Jiro. There certainly is craftsmanship and art to making sushi&amp;ndash; which Jiro has dedicated his life to.</description>

The attendance was pretty massive as this user group is getting bigger and bigger every month. I enjoyed the speaker and presentation a lot. I do notice that it&amp;rsquo;s a trend that there are a lot of startup businesses growing outside of Silicon Valley.

      <description>As a foodie and photography enthusiast, I found Food Photography: From Snapshots to Great Shots to be a good read, mostly. Although, I did find myself skimming the later chapters as they deal with post-processing using Adobe Photoshop.
The first three chapters on fundamentals, equipment, and lighting I thought were the best for foodies interested in improving their skills as a photographer. The chapter on framing and composition is good too.</description>

      <description>I just finished reading In The Plex: How Google Thinks, Works, and Shapes Our Lives on my Kindle Fire.
Overall it was a good book with some insight into Google, but I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say that the book was well-written. It does jump around a lot and the material wasn&amp;rsquo;t presented chronologically in story-fashion. It&amp;rsquo;s currently the most up to date book on Google as it includes recent stuff such as Android, Eric Schmidt&amp;rsquo;s stepping down as CEO in 2010, and it&amp;rsquo;s failures to enter as a social network.</description>

It was a very nice meetup about essentially building a community of designers. There were a lot of ideas thrown out about what the group could be about. I personally would like to have a community to turn to, in-person, for me to learn more about the tools and techniques in graphics design&amp;ndash; notably Photoshop, Lightroom, and Aperture.</description>

      <description>I really enjoyed reading the Steve Jobs biography by Walter Isaacson. I bought both the hardcover and the Kindle book version. Isaacson&amp;rsquo;s writing is superb and flows very well. However, if you read articles or even watched some Steve Jobs documentaries, it covers a lot of similar ground. I am reminded of the TV movie, Pirates of Silicon Valley. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t watched it, I highly recommend it.
I think it&amp;rsquo;s fair for people to compare him to Thomas Edison, as Jobs was our modern day inventor and businessman&amp;ndash; a visionary if you will.</description>

So I went on Amazon and bought the Western Digital WD TV Live Streaming Media Player for $90 US. Behold, my new HTPC.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it for a few days, and overall I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy with it. I was able to hook up my external USB hard drives to a D-Link DUB-H7 High Speed USB 2.</description>

      <description>I drove up to San Francisco from LA to check out the SF Ruby group. The drive was long, but worth it as I got to meet some interesting people. The meetup was hosted at ZenDesk. Being from Chicago and now living in LA, I never before heard so much talk about venture capital (VCs) coming from developers. I think there really is a culture difference in SF compared to other cities.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been in living in Los Angeles for two months now. About a month ago I finally bought a car to get around in. On Monday, December 5, 2011, I was able to attend my first the Los Angeles .Net Developer&amp;rsquo;s Group hosted at Blankspaces.
There were two presentations:
 Daniel Egan presented on Diving into Windows Phone Market: Should I make the jump? Henry Lee presented on Making Money with Windows Phone.</description>

      <description>I pre-ordered my Kindle Fire in early October. I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted an eReader device for a long time, ever since I&amp;rsquo;ve been traveling so much. Carrying books around is such a pain.
Like many others out there, I got my Kindle Fire on November 15, 2011. After a few weeks of using the Fire, I felt I could give it a good review. I&amp;rsquo;ve used it for playing Words With Friends, some basic browsing on Amazon, and I finished reading the Steve Jobs biography on it.</description>

      <description>When I found out that BitBucket added support for Git, I got pretty excited.
Just this past year I started to use Git as my DVCS for all my projects. More importantly, my older projects didn&amp;rsquo;t have any version control whatsoever. They were projects spread across multiple computers that only merged into a single external USB hard drive when I started to retire some computers because they were just too old (six plus years!</description>

      <description>Over the weekend I went with my sister and friends to check out BlizzCon&amp;nbsp;at the Anaheim Convention Center. Obviously we&amp;rsquo;re all fans of the games that Blizzard Entertainment make, and it was everyone&amp;rsquo;s first time attending. We had a blast!
It was a very tiring two days (Friday and Saturday, Oct 21-22, 2011). Doors opened around 9-9:30am, and the events lasted until midnight! I went around and snapped photos as much as I could, while attending some panels and Starcraft 2 tournaments.</description>

      <description>Last night I went to my favorite local user group, Chicago Alt.net (@ChicagoAltNet).
Eduardo Scoz presented on Objective-C and iOS. Great talk and a very big turnout. I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen this many developers show up for an Alt.net meetup here since Uncle Bob Martin did a presentation.
Here are some of the photos I took. If you are looking for a full set of photos I took from various meetups I attend, including this one, I dump them all in this Picasa album.</description>

      <description>Last week I used my JetBlue BluePass to head out to Los Angeles to attend the LA Ruby Meetup (@laruby) hosted at CoLoft. I was impressed with the turnout, the speakers and presentation, and the audience participation. The format of the meetup was pretty long though. I&amp;rsquo;m used to maybe thirty minutes to one hour of a presentation. They had four presentations lasting about two hours! All very good of course, but I have to admit that it was a bit tiring.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m suffering from San Diego Comic Con 2010 withdrawal still. This year I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to go as a good friend was getting married and I was his best man&amp;ndash; which turned out to be the best wedding I&amp;rsquo;ve ever been to. But anyway, you can see my post and pictures from that here.
So this year I made a last minute decision to go to Wizard World&amp;rsquo;s Chicago&amp;rsquo;s Comic Con.</description>

      <description>It was the summer of 2010 that I decided I wanted to dust off the DSLR I bought in 2006 and put it to good use more often. So throughout that summer, I made an effort to bring my camera with me everywhere I went. I brought it to work, to my various meetups I attended, and even when I walked around Chicago. I just kept taking photos of whatever I thought was interesting.</description>

      <description>In July of 2010, I quit my full time job as a software developer. I wanted to break away from the nine-to-five, travel a bit, have fun, and teach myself new things in the process. I was able to visit San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston, New York City, Denver, Bangkok, Chiang Mai, and Pattaya.

In 2011, I kept traveling, I visited Hua Hin, Phuket, Phang Nga, Singapore, Las Vegas, and Baltimore, before returning to Chicago for a time period greater than one week.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m so excited and I just can&#39;t hide it. - Pointer Sisters (reference)  I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Spotify now for a few weeks already. I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed it so much I upgraded to a premium account the very same day I signed up for it, so I could enjoy it on my mobile smartphone. Overall it&amp;rsquo;s been a great service that I use almost daily. For a long time I&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting for music to hit the cloud, and this year alone it&amp;rsquo;s really been a hit.</description>

On my plane rides, I met many other jet-setters flying around the US. I remember having interesting conversations with them, and even on one flight, sitting next to a dog!</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I purchased a Herman Miller Aeron chair from Home and Office Solutions up in Northbrook, Illinois. I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted an Aeron for the longest time, but just never felt comfortable spending a thousand dollars on an office chair. My seven-year old Ikea chair was falling apart and wasn&amp;rsquo;t comfortable anymore. To be honest, it started to fall apart after two years. I really needed to get a new chair.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been using G+ now for about a month. I scored an invite early on, and a few days later invited a good chunk of people from my Gmail contacts. I went through the process of making circles, refining the circles, installing the add-ons into my Chrome browser, and so forth.</description>

      <description>In The History of Social Networks Part 1, I covered the legacy social networks that I was once a part of. I use the term legacy to mean out-dated, unpopular, and in some cases discontinued.
Now I&amp;rsquo;m going to cover the current social networks that I am active on today. I guess you can say that these are my picks, for now.
Facebook I remember when I first heard about Facebook.</description>

I upgraded my Rebel XT to a Canon 60D a few weeks ago. I also got a Canon 60D battery grip with Canon EW78D Lens Hood. Overall, I&amp;rsquo;m very happy with these purchases. I love the 60D, it&amp;rsquo;s such a great step up from the Rebel XT, which I purchased 5 years ago. It feels good to use, and the pictures are also great, as expected from Canon.</description>

      <description>Paul Adams has an insightful presentation: The Real Life Social Network. It&amp;rsquo;s a great read, but it is a little long (224 slides)! Basically, he points out that the social network isn&amp;rsquo;t a fad, that it&amp;rsquo;s here to stay, and he goes through to talk about how relationships are, online/offline, behaviors, etcetera. Check it out if you have some time.
Since I started using computers, there&amp;rsquo;s always been a yearning to connect with others online&amp;ndash; through a social network in some way, shape, or form.</description>

I already posted on Barcamp Chicago in a previous blog post.

I watched it last night and wanted to share my thoughts on the movie with other fans and others that may have watched the movie already. I still recommend people to go watch the movie though, to read the comics, and/or then come talk to me.

I must say that some of the neighborhoods in the evening/night didn&amp;rsquo;t feel to safe to walk through. Also, the taxis there are so very expensive!</description>

      <description>I had a great time at RailsConf 2011, which took place in Baltimore, Maryland this year. Got the chance to meet and talk with a lot of Rails developers and passionate people. Always a good thing. I admit that I&amp;rsquo;m a Ruby Nuby, and quite a few of the talks were a little over my head, but in general there was a talk for everyone, no matter what skill level in Ruby/Rails.</description>

      <description>Chicago Code Camp 2011 (CCC3) has wrapped up! I had a great time going to various sessions, learning new things, and meeting/talking with great people. I wish more of these events would take place in the Chicagoland area. I think about 300 people attended, which I think is pretty good considering the event wasn&amp;rsquo;t even in Chicago! This year, CCC3 took place at College of Lake County, in Grayslake, which is located about 50 miles from Chicago (approximately 1 hour drive).</description>

      <description>I went to Singapore over the weekend (April 21-25) for Red Dot Ruby Conf. It was my first time to Singapore. I didn&amp;rsquo;t travel around too much, as I was in a conference for two full days (Friday and Saturday).
Some things I noticed about Singapore:
 No mosquitoes Hot and humid like Bangkok, but more pleasant Plenty of jay-walkers Seems the major things to do are shop and eat 3G is everywhere, generally very good Singlish takes some getting used to Singapore is full of folks from everywhere Super clean everywhere No traffic-- seems well managed  I ate out often at hawker centers.</description>

      <description>I wanted to write a quick post on my experience with getting a SIM card in Singapore.
When I arrived to Changi Airport, I immediately went to get a SIM card from a money exchange booth. They seemed to only offer prepaid SIM cards in $50, $100, and $150 SGD if I&amp;rsquo;m not mistaken. Since I was only staying for 4 days, I chose the smallest one: $50 SGD.</description>

      <description>As part of my trip back to the US, I attended Red Dot Ruby Conf 2011 on April 22-23, 2011. This event takes place in Singapore, at the Singapore Management University (SMU).
I had an awesome time. I enjoy going to these social technology events. Got a chance to talk and hang out with a lot of smart folks. I really enjoy the Ruby/Rails community

      <description>The BKK Web Meetup last night was pretty awesome. It was the biggest turnout I&amp;rsquo;ve seen yet, and it was also very interactive. Plenty of discussion, questions, and even stories came from the attendees.
The topic was: Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about hiring and training developers. Benjamin Scherrey was the presenter. Some bullet points that I took away:
 There are some cultural barriers to understand in hiring a Thai/Asian software developer. There are some cultural barriers dealing with Thai clients.</description>

I was flying Korea Air for the first time. On my way to Bangkok, Thailand, I had a layover at S. Korea. Some pictures I took at the airport:</description>

      <description>Just want to give a quick overview of my life since mid 2010 to present, early 2011. This is part 1 of 2.
For several years I was a software developer/consultant at a few companies and organizations. I mostly used .Net and Microsoft technologies as my tools for solving problems. In July of 2010, I decided to quit my 9-5 job and try new things out. I bought a Macbook Pro and decided that I wanted to get away from .</description>

      <description>A few weeks back, on March 3 2011, I attended TEDxBKK over at TCDC at the top floor at Emporium in Bangkok, Thailand. You can also follow them on twitter at @tedxbkk. Overall it was a good turnout, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t too enthusiastic about most of the talks though. The one that stuck out the most for me was David Christian&amp;rsquo;s talk in the Knowledge Revolution session.

      <description>I started a new blog/website over at foodishappiness.com. I exported all my food posts from this site as well as from bestburgerintown.blogspot.com (which I&amp;rsquo;ve abandoned) and imported them into the new site. It&amp;rsquo;s just something new I wanted to try out, to see if I could generate content from my food/eating passion. I&amp;rsquo;m still on an &amp;ldquo;eating tour&amp;rdquo; of Bangkok, Thailand so to speak.

I know many say that blogs are dead.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been in Thailand now for a little over two months now. Although I miss the US a lot, I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning a lot of new things, and meeting a lot of wonderful people here in Bangkok. In other words, I&amp;rsquo;m having a blast out here.
The day after I arrived, November 9 2010, I attended a Bangkok Hackerspace meetup at True Coffee (Siam Soi 2). I walked in thinking it was going to be something akin to Jelly Chicago and community building.</description>

      <description>So back in May of 2010, I bought myself a Macbook Pro. I bought it for several reasons:
 I wanted a new toy/gadget to play with. I wanted to try the only other operating system (OS) I haven&#39;t really spent much time on (OS X). I wanted to get away from Microsoft technologies  Those were and are the 3 main reasons.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a little over 8 months of usage and I absolutely love it.</description>

From July&amp;rsquo;s trip to the San Diego Comic-Con, to September&amp;rsquo;s All-You-Can-Jet pass, to even now, Thailand! It&amp;rsquo;s been awesome, but there&amp;rsquo;s a special shout-out I need to give recognition to: eBags.com
On October 5, 2010, at the end of my All-You-Can-Jet vacationing, after hitting up 5 cities in one month, my main traveling bag: the Mother Lode eTech Junior 25 Wheeled Duffel, had ripped at the baggage claim at O&amp;rsquo;hare International Airport.</description>

As part of my trip out there, I visited Boston University, where I attended as an undergraduate from 1997 to 2001. While visiting the campus, I took some pictures of the undergraduate CS lab, where I worked long long ago. Different, but yet the same!

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve received numerous requests asking for help on how to install Thai fonts onto an Android device after my initial post on Rooting my Nexus One and installing Thai fonts. Since I do update my Android phone with the CyanogenMod ROM quite often (which wipes the Thai fonts on each install), I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share a simple shell script to help get Thai fonts onto Android.

      <description>A few months ago, Tony Hsieh, the CEO of Zappos, offered free copies of his new book, Delivering Happiness: A Path to Profits, Passion, and Purposevia his twitter. I hopped on it right away and got myself two copies of it by using two different email addresses. I gave one away to a friend and kept the remaining copy to myself to keep and read.
I really enjoyed this book. It&amp;rsquo;s inspirational how Tony Hsieh started his company out, taking the big risks he did, despite the economic conditions of the Dot Com bubble burst.</description>

I was studying at the time, but once I got my email notification that it arrived, I rushed to pick it up and did a little photoshoot of my Android toy at the table I was studying at. I played with the aperture for most of the shoot (in AV mode). Afterwards, I used Adobe Lightroom to polish it up a bit (created a set of Black &amp;amp; White photos too).</description>

      <description>I was at an event last week at the rooftop of 63 E. Lake Street and I was able to take some photos of the Millennium Park Bean and parts of Chicago.



These photos were taken with my Canon Digital Rebel XT with a Canon EF-S 55-250mm f/4.0-5.6 IS Telephoto Zoom Lens.</description>

      <description>On my way to Los Angeles from San Diego, I had the opportunity to stop by the Blizzard Entertainment HQ in Irvine, California. I must say that they have an awesome campus with very developer/designer friendly offices. Toys and models everywhere!
Here some pictures, full set of pictures can be found here.

      <description>I made sure to take a lot of photos this month.
Tuesday July 6, 2010 Chicago Ruby had a meeting over at ThoughtWorks. Snapped a few photos there. Very cool talks. And of course, pizza. You can sign up for these meetings at: Chicago Ruby Meetup. There was a Hack Night on Thursday of the week, but I did not take any photos.

      <description>Plenty of events to attend for the month of July! This will be the first time I&amp;rsquo;m attending a Ruby event, so I&amp;rsquo;m pretty excited. Sadly, things may be a bit over my head since I just started doing Ruby.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m going to start posting pictures I take from various Tech Events I attend. One, I&amp;rsquo;m doing it because I want to share visually, what the Tech community looks like. And two, because I&amp;rsquo;m picking up photography as a hobby now.
The pictures below are from Chicago Code Camp, which took place May 1st, 2010 at the Stuart Building at IIT. They were taken by me with my Google Nexus One.</description>

      <description>I first read about Balsamiq Mockups a few weeks ago on StackOverflow.
In general I agree with what Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky said about the product on their podcast (IT Conversations: Episode 47). It really is a simple mockup tool that isn&amp;rsquo;t about being exact and precise, but rather sketchy and fast so you can get your idea down quickly. It makes starting something easy and fast, so you can move on to what&amp;rsquo;s next.</description>

      <description>I finished reading Rework by the founders of 37Signals. I really really enjoyed the book. The chapters were concise and to the point.
Here are my favorite chapters:
 Learning from mistakes is overrated Planning is guessing No time is no excuse Outside money is Plan Z Embrace constraints Focus on won&#39;t change Interruption is the enemy of productivity Meetings are toxic Your estimates suck Underdo your competition Say no by default Emulate chefs Drug dealers get it right Do it yourself first Everybody works They&#39;re not thirteen Don&#39;t scar on the first cut  I highly recommend people to pick up a copy if you are at all interested in how a great business should be run.</description>

Tuesday March 2, 2010 Chicago Agile Project Management Meetup Group I&amp;rsquo;ve been a member of this meetup group for a while now. I really made an effort to attend this one since the topic was on estimating projects.</description>

      <description>I finished reading Coders at Work! I really enjoyed the interviews with Jamie Zawinksi, Douglas Crockford, Brendan Eich, and Ken Thompson. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t too interested in compilers and the much older systems some of the programmers once developed in. I must admit, I had a short attention span reading over those sections.
Anyway, the reason I picked this book up was because back in late September to early October 2009, I remember reading several blog posts on duct tape programming.</description>

I knew I was eventually going to get it, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t know until that moment that that was the moment I was going to get it.
I bought the phone yesterday, 1/5/2010, at 1:05pm. Overnight FedEx shipping (free). It arrived today at 1:22pm.</description>

      <description>I am primarily a Microsoft software developer. But I was not always a M$FT user/developer so to speak. I used to use Windows 3.1 back in the heyday, followed a little with Windows 95&amp;frasl;98. But by then, I was a college student at Boston University. The computer labs there had primarily Unix terminals and Solaris boxes. So I naturally had to use and learn these technologies. Everything from using the command shell, pine, star office, gcc compiler, etc.</description>

Anyway, after using iTunes for a little over a year and hundreds of songs purchased later, it was starting up slower and slower.</description>

Mind you, these aren&amp;rsquo;t just the free editions of their software, these are Standard to Professional editions that individuals and companies pay a lot of money for.
The catch is that you need to be a student with a student email. (Something like student.name@myuniversity.edu).
They currently offer:

      <description>This morning I had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, toasted. It was delicious. Along with it I had some orange juice (OJ), but not just any OJ, Minute Maid OJ.

For years I&amp;rsquo;ve been more of a Tropicana OJ kind-of-guy, but with Tropicana&amp;rsquo;s somewhat recent logo switch on their cartons, I just felt compelled to switch.
The reason? I just don&amp;rsquo;t get why they changed their logo.
What they had before made sense (see left carton).</description>

      <description>Google Reader is by far my favorite web application. I reorganized many of the labels as well as added/deleted some feeds. But I truly consider this app as my gateway to the Internet. I have it set as a tab that always opens up in any of my browsers.
What makes it my favorite is that it collects all my favorite websites/blogs into one simple screen. I don&amp;rsquo;t care about actually visiting the website unless it has an article/blog post that I&amp;rsquo;m actually interested in commenting or reading comments on.</description>

Can you see what&amp;rsquo;s wrong?

It&amp;rsquo;s behind a 100 Grand, one of the worst pieces of candy in the entire machine. I haven&amp;rsquo;t enjoyed a 100 Grand since I was a kid, which is probably the age of the candy since everybody knows it&amp;rsquo;s stale and gross.</description>

      <description>For Christmas 2008, I got a iRobot 560 Roomba Vacuuming Robot, Black and Silveras a combined gift from my sisters and their boyfriends. I must say, that this is the best Xmas gift I&amp;rsquo;ve ever received other than the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), around 1988-1989. Which was 20 years ago&amp;hellip; wow.

The Roomba actually does a pretty decent job of cleaning my apartment. My apartment is about 620 sq ft and mostly carpet.</description>

      <description>There are some really cool GPS applications out there that are about to push the boundaries of technology and social media as we know it. I remember years ago when I shared a link to Loopt with friends, pretty much everyone didn&amp;rsquo;t like the idea of sharing that much information with each other. Today, I already have a few friends jumping onto to use such an app. Google has now also released a similar application out called Google Latitude, but based on their Google login system.</description>

      <description>After hearing that several friends will be doing the Shamrock Shuffle this year, I decided I wanted to challenge myself to it again. I did it two years ago, in 2007. I did little to no training for that, and ran at about a 13min/mile pace. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to bring that down to a 10min/mile pace with some proper training.
I look at this as a way to start out 2009 and hopefully, the rest of my life: As a fresh start to making a better me.</description>

      <description>I absolutely love reading CodingHorror.com. It&amp;rsquo;s easily one of my favorite blogs to read about problem solving from the viewpoint of a programming/developer. Recently, Jeff Atwood posted a problem:
Let&#39;s say, hypothetically speaking, you met someone who told you they had two children, and one of them is a girl. What are the odds that person has a boy and a girl? I was surprised by the number of readers who responded who got it wrong, very wrong.</description>

      <description>My parents have a Thai TV ethernet box of some kind so they can tune in to their Thai stations, shows, and even radio on their HDTV. However, I had to run a 50 foot CAT5 cable from the upstairs to the first floor great room, which is quite messy. So for Christmas this year, I bought them a Linksys-Cisco WRT54GL Wireless-G Broadband Router.
The setup I wanted was to have the Thai TV box, which uses an ethernet port for all data, connect to the wireless router, and have the wireless router connect to the wireless router upstairs.</description>

      <description>To my recollection, I&amp;rsquo;ve only ever participated in a Black Friday event back in 2006. And it was really really tough. In a nutshell, I went shopping at midnight, went home to nap, then went out again to shop during the day, totally 15 some hours of shopping by day&amp;rsquo;s end. It&amp;rsquo;s something that I hope to never do again in my life. (Note: I only did this because some girls wanted to do some shopping).</description>

      <description>Firefox is my favorite web browser. In this day and age, I see no need to use Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Internet Explorer (IE). Although I do like Google Chrome, it&amp;rsquo;s still not available for Linux yet. But this isn&amp;rsquo;t an entry about browsers and the pros and cons of each. (I do plan on writing about browsers and operating systems in the near future.)
This is the list of add-ons that I install on any computer I use running Firefox.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had my G1 for a few weeks now. My overall impressions are pretty good. I like the touch screen, I like the free applications available through the market app, and I definitely enjoy the web browsing experience on the 3G network over my old Blackberry Pearl on the EDGE network.
But I do have a few complaints:
 Battery Life is too short. I can maybe go for a maximum of 2 days without a recharge if I very minimal use of the phone.</description>

      <description>I witnessed history in the making last night by attending Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s Election Night in Grant Park.
How I got the ticket: Sheer Luck
It all started after I got my lunch and was heading back to the office. A lady one floor beneath mine hopped on the elevator early (she wanted to go down, I was going up, but a co-worker of hers just got off), and she mentioned to her co-worker that if got his ticket yet.</description>

      <description>Last weekend I installed Ubuntu Linux onto my Lenovo Thinkpad T60 laptop. I wanted to keep Windos XP Professional installed, so I chose to dual-boot it using GRUB. I also upgraded the 40 GB hard drive to a 250 GB hard drive using a laptop hard drive upgrade kit. I copied the files over to the new drive, and then installed Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy Heron) in another partition. It was amazingly simple.</description>

I charged it and have been playing with it since. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably do a review of it later.</description>

      <description>Next week, on October 22, I should be getting my pre-ordered T-Mobile G1, in black. Sadly though, in order to pre-order this device, I had to extend my contract with T-Mobile until September 28, 2010. I found out the exact date by a letter they sent me thanking me for choosing to continue my relationship and extending my contract with them.
Let me get one thing straight, I extended the contract only to get my hand on a device running Google Android.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I visited San Francisco (SF) for the first time with my baby sister. My sister was busy with law school, so the planning was mostly up to me, and I needed recommendations on what to do there. So I started a Google Docs for myself at first and then added collaborators to help edit it. These collaborators were all friends from SF.
It then turned into a wiki-style collaboration document.</description>

      <description>TinyURLis a website that condenses a submitted URL, usually a long one, into a short readable URL on tinyurl&amp;rsquo;s website. In turn, this shorter URL then redirects to the original url. This is quite handy.
As of this writing, the text below their logo reads:
Making long URLs usable! More than 90 million of them. Over 1.5 billion hits/month. From what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen, they only use letters and numbers. So that gives us 26 possible letters, which are not case-sensitive (in other words, &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo; is the same as &amp;ldquo;a&amp;rdquo;).</description>

Problem: Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print &amp;ldquo;Fizz&amp;rdquo; instead of the number and for the multiples of five print &amp;ldquo;Buzz&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>For almost ten years now, I still find myself fixing computers for friends. It&amp;rsquo;s not so much hardware these days as it is cleaning out viruses and installing software to handle a certain task. I don&amp;rsquo;t mind so much, but I just hope my friends learn something from what I do and explain rather than to just rely on me to fix everything for them each and every time.
Anyway, for protecting a computer running Windows, an Antivirus software is required along with receiving regular updates.</description>

      <description>I used to use Prodigy as my Internet Service Provider (ISP) back in the 1990s. It was fun to post to bulletin boards and participate in various discussions. I then jumped over to use America Online (AOL) because of it&amp;rsquo;s nicer interface, live chat rooms, email, instant messaging, buddy lists, and overall better features. To be honest, back then I used the Internet for two things: to talk about wrestling and find Dragonball Z pictures.</description>

      <description>A few years ago I envisioned a world where computers would return back to acting more like terminal PCs connected to a mainframe. A world where accessing files/applications locally would be a thing of the past. In a way, that&amp;rsquo;s what Cloud Computing seems to be about. A user can be on any computer (albeit a PC, a Mac, or a Linux box), all that is required is Internet connection and a web browser, and the user can run most of his/her computing needs.</description>

      <description>Up to this point in my consulting career, too often I&amp;rsquo;ve seen consultants (myself included) spend time writing documents describing what will be and won&amp;rsquo;t be included in the project. And pretty much every time, whatever the client committed to on paper, isn&amp;rsquo;t what the client wanted in the end. Requirements change between the start and end of a project. This is software development as it truly is.
Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I&amp;rsquo;m not saying documentation is bad all together.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s a voting system, so there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of crap stories, and just a few winners here and there. But sometimes those stories are worth it. Sometimes&amp;hellip;
Anyway, I went to the Digg Meetup event yesterday with a co-worker and I thought it was just ok. Kevin Rose spoke a little, threw out some free schwag, interacted with the crowd, typical stuff.</description>

      <description>I just finished reading Groundswell: Winning in a World Transformed by Social Technologies. Probably one of the best books I&amp;rsquo;ve read this year thus far.
 What Is Groundswell? It&#39;s a book by two Forrester analysts with practical, data-based strategies for companies that want to harness the power of social technologies like blogs, social networks, and YouTube. (source: Forrester) I absolutely love reading case studies in these IT Business books. I finished my MS in Information Systems 2 years ago last month.</description>

      <title>Where is the Blogger Community?</title>

      <description>I recently started a new blog over at Vox.com after my older sister recommended me the site after a friend of hers recommended it to her. It&amp;rsquo;s a social blogging website that emphasizes on the concept of a neighborhood; essentially socializing with other people with common interests, etc.
Anyway, I still really like Blogger, but where the heck is the community? I&amp;rsquo;m sure I can search for it through Google, but can&amp;rsquo;t there be some kind of interface that can help users find each other?</description>

      <description>I went on an online shopping spree earlier this week and bought some Man bags for myself. I only bought 2, but from the set below, I&amp;rsquo;m showing 2 because I ordered the one on the left (the more green/olive color), but I received the one on the right (brownish/dark-green). At first I was going to send it back, but I grew attached to the color and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to go through the hassle of sending it back.</description>

      <description>Over the weekend, mostly on Saturday I spent doing 2 main things:
 Tried to install Microsoft Visual Studio .Net 2008 onto my Lenovo Thinkpad T60 laptop Installed Linux onto my PS3  The development tool installation didn&amp;rsquo;t take well at all, but the Linux install went very well, a bit long to download, install, and configure everything, but overall very well. The distro I chose was Yellow Dog Linux, specifically for the PS3.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the better part of this cold weekend indoors trying to configure my PS3 to work on the Playstation Network. My problem was that I would get lag when playing Puzzle Fighter 3 Turbo HD Remix. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the Belkin Pre-N Router for the past few months for everything but gaming and have been content with it. But frankly, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t play well with my PS3! I went to portforward.</description>

      <title>PS3 and Bluray is the way to go... for now</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a PS3 owner, but mostly for the opposite reasons according to a co-worker. Most people own a PS3 for the games and then the blu-ray movies is a big plus. I like it for the blu-ray movie playing ability, and then the games are a plus. And with the recent announcement that Warner is going to be blu-ray exclusive too, it pretty much seals the fate of the HDDVD.</description>

      <title>Best Free Software of 2008 (so far)</title>

      <description>I find myself reinstalling software on another friend&amp;rsquo;s laptop yet again. What was the problem? Computer virii, trojan horses, adware, and spyware made the system unstable. How did it get this way? Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s because of not having a good understanding of computers, but in particular, peer-to-peer(P2P) programs such as BearShare.
Here is a list of the most common FREE programs I recommend for typical users:
 Antivirus: Avast Home Edition or AVG Free Firewall: Comodo Firewall Web Browser: Mozilla Firefox Spyware detection: Microsoft Defender Image Editing: Paint.</description>

      <description>As 2007 comes to a close, it marks the end of one year, and the beginning of another. So too does it bring an end more or less of my blogging on spong.org. It was a personal side project of I started 9 years ago before blogs and other free services were available. Now I&amp;rsquo;m reading to officially say that I&amp;rsquo;m stopping development on it as I have other things in my life I wish to focus on.</description>

      <description>I got myself a new mp3 player, the Sansa e280. I used to have an Apple iPod mini, but the battery life on that device was just horrible after less than one year. I was thinking of getting a new Ipod, but I was sick of Apple&amp;rsquo;s proprietary music format. I love iTunes, but it&amp;rsquo;s a bit bloated. So now I use either plain old winamp or the relatively new open source, Songbird.</description>
