  <p>It was the summer of 2010 that I decided I wanted to dust off the DSLR I bought in 2006 and put it to good use more often. So throughout that summer, I made an effort to bring my camera with me everywhere I went. I brought it to work, to my various meetups I attended, and even when I walked around Chicago. I just kept taking photos of whatever I thought was interesting.</p>

<p><img   border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WuLnoARIQSA/TxVm8julanI/AAAAAAAA2qw/QJGYhDm_jo0/s600/IMG_1101.jpeg" /></p>

<p>I discovered that I really enjoyed taking photos and sharing them with everyone on my social networks. I felt that I wanted to share the things that were going on around me. From comic conventions, a friend&rsquo;s night out, someone presenting at a meetup or conference, or the food I was eating&ndash; I enjoy publishing it for all the world to see.</p>

<p><strong>I&rsquo;ve realized that photography, like blogging, is a form of story-telling.</strong> <em>At least that&rsquo;s how I like to photograph</em>. It&rsquo;s no surprise then that photography would become one of my new favorite hobbies. Like writing/blogging, photography is a craft I want to get better at. I recently came across a blog post: <a href="http://photofocus.com/2011/07/08/want-to-be-a-better-photographer-become-a-better-writer/">Want to be a Better Photographer? Become a Better Writer</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/scottbourne">Scott Bourne</a>. That post points out that all these things have a strong correlation.</p>

<p>But it also occurred to me recently, that coding has a lot of similarities to photography and blogging.</p>

<p><strong>Software development is basically a form of communication. </strong>I am reminded of the post: <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/11/coding-its-just-writing.html">Coding: It&rsquo;s Just Writing</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/codinghorror">Jeff Atwood</a>. <strong>When a developer writes code, it&rsquo;s basically writing.</strong> The developer communicates to the computer, what the developer wants the computer to do, in the form of code. A developer also communicates to other developers, project managers, and clients verbally, through emails, or even instant messages. Check out <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/">Jon Skeet&rsquo;s</a> answer to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/477310/are-good-programmers-good-writers/477319#477319">Are good programmers good writers?</a> I very much agree with his statement:</p>

<blockquote class="tr_bq"><em>"clear thinking leads to clear code" </em>- Jon Skeet </blockquote>

<p>I must thank <a href="http://www.stackoverflow/">Stackoverflow</a>, for helping developers to combine writing and coding together. For me, the very act of writing out a question on any of the <a href="http://www.stackexchange.com/">StackExchange</a> (SE) sites, helps me get closer to finding an answer. To write a question so that others could answer, requires thinking and organization. It needs to be concise, show effort, and it has to be clear. There were probably a dozen or so questions I was going to post on some of these SE sites, that I ended up answering on my own because I sat down to clearly think and write what I needed help on. <em>Of course I didn&rsquo;t bother posting the question once I figured out the answer, but in hindsight, I guess I should have.</em></p>

<p>So in essence, photography, blogging, coding are all forms of story-telling and writing. They provide a means to achieve clarity. I really enjoy doing all of the above. What&rsquo;s awesome about it is, there&rsquo;s no <em>done-learning</em> to any of them. You can just keep doing them for months, years, even decades, and still find ways to improve and enjoy the art.</p>
