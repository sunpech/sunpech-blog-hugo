<p>Last month in July, I purchased two Android phones: <a href="http://www.google.com/nexus/5/">The Nexus 5</a> (N5) and the <a href="http://www.oneplus.net/">OnePlus One</a> (OPO). I initially ordered the Nexus 5 because I was sick of waiting for an OnePlus invite that I signed up for in April. Up until then, I was using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_Nexus">Galaxy Nexus</a> for two years and its overall performance was rather sluggish and could no longer hold a charge for half a day.</p>

<p>I got the white Nexus 5 (16GB). I had it only for a few weeks before I got a OnePlus invite in mid-July. I had to act quickly since the invite was good for only 24 hours. I was already happy with the Nexus 5, but here I was given an opportunity to try out something highly sought after. So after some talking I was able to find a new home for my Nexus 5 and decided to move forward to be one of the lucky few OPO owners.</p>

<h2 id="nexus-5">Nexus 5</h2>

<p><b>I consider the Nexus 5 to be the best Nexus device that Google has made to date</b>. I&rsquo;ve used the G1, Nexus One, Nexus S, Galaxy Nexus, and the current one&ndash; basically all the Nexus devices except for the Nexus 4.</p>

<p>Prior to the N5, I&rsquo;ve always felt that the Nexus One was the best Nexus device for its time. I even wrote about <a href="/2010/01/my-new-phone-googles-nexus-one">my unboxing of the Nexus One</a> back in 2010. The device <i>still</i> works well running an old Cyanogen ROM on it.</p>

<p><b>What I love about the N5 is that it&rsquo;s light, fast, and has a great battery life</b>. I can get through a day easily with it. My carrier is T-Mobile and the reception is amazing on it&ndash; I have 4G/LTE everywhere I went in Los Angeles. It&rsquo;s also a cheap device: $400.</p>

<p>At first I thought that the phone would be too big and uncomfortable to use. After using it for only a few weeks, I found that this wasn&rsquo;t the case at all. The Nexus 5 fits really well in hand and because it&rsquo;s so light, it&rsquo;s easy to maneuver around with one hand.</p>

<p>I cannot think of a single thing to dislike about this phone. None.</p>

<p><img   border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-__MwiiGAWVg/U-Ls8TcAXPI/AAAAAAABv9I/i7kOcQq827o/s600/2014-07-02+at+14-20-30.jpg" alt=""  style="color: #0000ee;"  /></p>

<h2 id="oneplus-one">OnePlus One</h2>

<p>The OPO is running <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/">Cyanogenmod</a> 11s and it runs it rather well. A concern I had about ordering this device is that it is even bigger than the Nexus 5!</p>

<p>What I love about it is that it boots and feels faster than the Nexus 5. The screen is nice and big and the CM build is rather nice. It&rsquo;s a cheap, 64GB black model ($350)&ndash; which has incredible value. A device of this build would normally sell for twice the cost! The battery life is also even better than the Nexus 5&ndash; I can get through almost 2 days of regular use!</p>

<p>It comes with it&rsquo;s own special USB charger, which gives it a nice flair. The 64GB model comes with the black backing, which a lot of people like how it looks and feels. I can&rsquo;t agree with that, as I prefer my mobile devices to look more sleek than sandpaper.</p>

<p>The CM Theme chooser is nice, but for the most part it&rsquo;s not something I really care for. I actually prefer the standard icons from vanilla Android as opposed to any of the custom themes, wallpapers, icons, etc. I also don&rsquo;t care for the Trebuchet launcher that comes with CM. But again, I prefer <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.launcher&amp;hl=en">Google Now launcher</a>, which is available for devices running Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean) and higher.</p>

<p>I also don&rsquo;t care for the camera much. Since I use my DSLR for my camera needs, I rarely use my Android devices to take pictures. As to the quality of the pictures produced, I don&rsquo;t really care for them as I tend to post process pictures I care about anyway.</p>

<p>What I don&rsquo;t like is that it&rsquo;s a heavier device than the Nexus 5. I can really notice it. The buttons aren&rsquo;t as nice as the Nexus 5. All the buttons don&rsquo;t feel as nice nor do I like the placement of the power button. It just feels a bit off in that I have to feel for where the buttons are. I also end up using the capacitive (software) screen buttons instead, and disabling the phone actual navigation buttons. <b>The phone&rsquo;s navigation buttons are located too low on the phone</b>, so it makes it hard to reach them without fumbling the phone out of your hand&ndash; the balance is not there. Plus it&rsquo;s limited to just back, home, and menu&ndash; which isn&rsquo;t quite the standard anymore.</p>

<p><b>The CM 11S build is also a bit buggy</b>. I get app crashes consistently on certain workflows. I do hope that they get fixed in the next update. Even the Android L Preview is more stable than this ROM.</p>

<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qDhuwNxE0Lw/U-QUGAtg4eI/AAAAAAABwEE/qLwyfqbGmcY/s600/2014-08-07+at+16-55-38.jpg" alt="" ><img   border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qDhuwNxE0Lw/U-QUGAtg4eI/AAAAAAABwEE/qLwyfqbGmcY/s600/2014-08-07+at+16-55-38.jpg" alt=""   /></a></p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><b>Between the Nexus 5 and the OPO, I actually prefer the Nexus 5.</b> This is because my needs for disk space isn&rsquo;t very high. 64GB is more than I really need for my on the go device. I don&rsquo;t store my music collection or movies on my phone. The Nexus 5 has <i>zero drawbacks,</i> while the OPO is a bit uncomfortable to use with the build and bugs I experience.</p>

<p>I will of course be keeping my OPO device. I am considering flashing the <a href="https://forums.oneplus.net/threads/rom-official-4-4-4-oneplus-aosp.65482/">Android 4.4.4 stock ROM (official)</a> onto it. It&rsquo;s really awesome that it&rsquo;s even available already. But I think I&rsquo;ll stick it out until the next CM update.</p>
