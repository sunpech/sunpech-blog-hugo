      <description>The Oakland Museum of California has one of my photos from San Diego Comic Con on display in their exhibit: Sunshine and Superheroes: San Diego Comic-Con. A few days ago I had the opportunity to visit and took some photos.
The exhibit runs from May 23, 2014 to May 31, 2015.
Below is the photo I took at SDCC in 2013 that they used. It&amp;rsquo;s taken on the escalators leading up to the ticket booths.</description>

      <description>I was up in San Francisco in late November and early December last year. It was a very last minute trip, but one I wanted to do for such a long time. I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to get some shots of the iconic Golden Gate Bridge in SF&amp;ndash; without any fog. My prior visits have always been foggy and I could never see the full bridge.
Well, this trip was somewhat dedicated to visiting the bridge several times to get some shots&amp;ndash; to which I was finally able to get some shots without fog.</description>

      <description>Last week I attended the Google+ Photographer&amp;rsquo;s Conference in San Francisco, May 22-23, 2012 at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts. The day before, I attended a photowalk at Golden Gate Park which I blogged about already.
Some things I observed and learned at the conference:
 Adobe Lightroom 4, Bridge, and Photoshop seem to be the digital tools of choice of many photographers. There are just as many Nikon users as there are Canon users.</description>

      <description>Last week I was up in San Francisco May 21-23 for the Google+ Photographer&amp;rsquo;s Conference. On Monday, there was an optional photowalk at about ten locations. I attended the one led by Scott Kelby at Golden Gate Park.
The photowalk was pretty fun. It&amp;rsquo;s the third photowalk I&amp;rsquo;ve been on so far, and in general I like to stray from the group, go at my own pace, and take shots of everything I find interesting.</description>

      <description>A few weekends ago I was in San Francisco for the Coldplay concert in San Jose at the HP Pavillion. Part of the weekend trip was hiking near Muir Woods. I brought my camera, tripod, and backpack with me and took some photos during my hike.
I had with me my Canon 5D Mark 3 with Canon 16-35mm f/2.8 L II lens&amp;nbsp;and Canon 24-105 f/4 L lens. I brought my Dolica tripod,&amp;nbsp;Canon 480EX II Speedlite flash, jacket, and some other stuff&amp;ndash; and&amp;nbsp;packed it all in my Lowepro Photo Sport 200 AW Backpack.</description>

      <description>There are some conferences and conventions coming up soon that I&amp;rsquo;m pretty excited about. So far I&amp;rsquo;m definitely going to Anime Expo and Comic-Con, as I purchased tickets for those already. Recently announced is the G+ Photographers Conference, which includes a Photowalk on Monday, May 21st. I will most likely make my way up there for that&amp;ndash; about eighty-percent sure I&amp;rsquo;ll go.
I plan to take my photography gear to take plenty of pictures too!</description>

      <description>I drove up to San Francisco from LA to check out the SF Ruby group. The drive was long, but worth it as I got to meet some interesting people. The meetup was hosted at ZenDesk. Being from Chicago and now living in LA, I never before heard so much talk about venture capital (VCs) coming from developers. I think there really is a culture difference in SF compared to other cities.</description>
