      <description>I&#39;m so excited and I just can&#39;t hide it. - Pointer Sisters (reference)  I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Spotify now for a few weeks already. I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed it so much I upgraded to a premium account the very same day I signed up for it, so I could enjoy it on my mobile smartphone. Overall it&amp;rsquo;s been a great service that I use almost daily. For a long time I&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting for music to hit the cloud, and this year alone it&amp;rsquo;s really been a hit.</description>

      <description>Several years ago, I tried out iTunes and really enjoyed the experience. I came from a Winamp background and really liked having a fast loading application. On top of that, I am a computer geek, so I already know where all my files are on the OS filesystem.
Anyway, after using iTunes for a little over a year and hundreds of songs purchased later, it was starting up slower and slower.</description>

      <description>I got myself a new mp3 player, the Sansa e280. I used to have an Apple iPod mini, but the battery life on that device was just horrible after less than one year. I was thinking of getting a new Ipod, but I was sick of Apple&amp;rsquo;s proprietary music format. I love iTunes, but it&amp;rsquo;s a bit bloated. So now I use either plain old winamp or the relatively new open source, Songbird.</description>
