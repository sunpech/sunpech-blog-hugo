      <description>Another year, another Comic Con (SDCC) in the bag!
The programming for this year&amp;rsquo;s Comic Con was different than other years as some of the big studios were not there&amp;ndash; namely Marvel Studios and HBO. I can understand Marvel Studios not being there this year, as they are between the Infinity War movies. They don&amp;rsquo;t want to give much information away in regards to how things are going to be in the coming movies and the next phase of their movie/storytelling development.</description>

      <description>San Diego Comic Con (SDCC) has come and gone. This year marks my seventh year going to SDCC! Each year I have a good time, but every year it becomes less about the convention floor, offsite experiences, and buying stuff. Going to the con is now more about taking photos and attending panels.
Cosplay I love taking photos of cosplayers, but it&amp;rsquo;s really difficult to be at the right place at the right time to catch some of the awesome cosplay.</description>

      <description>Just got back from San Diego Comic Con and I&amp;rsquo;m super exhausted! My sisters and I were lucky this year and we got rooms at the Manchester Grand Hyatt, just a few blocks away from the convention center. I even nabbed myself a Superman Conan FunkoPop that was being raffled away in the very same hotel we were staying at!
The weather was hot as the sun was unforgiving most of the time during the day.</description>

      <description>Last week I was in San Diego for Comic Con. This year marks my fifth time that I&amp;rsquo;ve been to San Diego Comic Con.
This month of July also marks twenty years since I attended my first comic convention in Chicago, when it was then known as Chicago Comic Con (it was bought by Wizard World in 1997).
The Good As usual, it&amp;rsquo;s always fun to go to the biggest geek party in the world.</description>

      <description>I really like the city of San Diego. It&amp;rsquo;s a very clean city with little to no smog in the air, unlike Los Angeles.
I was there for Comic Con a few days early last week. So I put aside some time to go take pictures of the skyline from Coronado Island. I did a little research on 500px and picked a spot that had a clear shot of the skyline.</description>

      <description>Last week I as in San Diego for Comic Con (SDCC). This visit marks my fourth visit to San Diego&amp;rsquo;s Comic Con, with next year (2015) marking twenty years since I attended my first comic con in Chicago. I cannot believe it&amp;rsquo;s been that long since I first ventured into a convention

This year I didn&amp;rsquo;t take as many pictures as I did in previous years. I think it&amp;rsquo;s mostly because I&amp;rsquo;m more interested in attending panels and enjoying myself.</description>

      <description>Last week I was in San Diego for Comic-Con. This was my third time at SDCC and I had a great time as usual. I took pictures as usual, but unlike previous years, I went to more panels than any other year.
Here are my albums on G+ (and Facebook&amp;ndash; FB):

      <description>Last week I went to the San Diego Comic Con (SDCC) and had a blast. The last time I went was back in 2010, which I blogged about here. I took quite a few photos, but only post-processed a fraction of them. I may choose to post-process more of them at a later date. You can view the full album here.
I attended SDCC with a 4-day pass along with preview night.</description>

      <description>There are some conferences and conventions coming up soon that I&amp;rsquo;m pretty excited about. So far I&amp;rsquo;m definitely going to Anime Expo and Comic-Con, as I purchased tickets for those already. Recently announced is the G+ Photographers Conference, which includes a Photowalk on Monday, May 21st. I will most likely make my way up there for that&amp;ndash; about eighty-percent sure I&amp;rsquo;ll go.
I plan to take my photography gear to take plenty of pictures too!</description>
