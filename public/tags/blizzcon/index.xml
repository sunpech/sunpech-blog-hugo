      <description>This past weekend I attended BlizzCon at the Anaheim Convention Center. I had a blast taking photos of cosplayers. I must say that Blizzard fans are some of the most dedicated super fans I&amp;rsquo;ve ever met. They love the games, the stories, and are really, really into the craft of cosplay. Other than at Anime Expo, these guys have the best cosplay I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen.
This year there was some news on all fronts, minus Warcraft 3 and some other older games of course.</description>

      <description>Over the weekend I went with my sister and friends to check out BlizzCon&amp;nbsp;at the Anaheim Convention Center. Obviously we&amp;rsquo;re all fans of the games that Blizzard Entertainment make, and it was everyone&amp;rsquo;s first time attending. We had a blast!
It was a very tiring two days (Friday and Saturday, Oct 21-22, 2011). Doors opened around 9-9:30am, and the events lasted until midnight! I went around and snapped photos as much as I could, while attending some panels and Starcraft 2 tournaments.</description>
