      <description>This past weekend I went to Star Wars Celebration in Chicago. This was my first Celebration event I attended so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what to expect. Overall, I&amp;rsquo;d say it was fun and very doable event for its size. What I mean by this is that larger cons like San Diego Comic Con is super fun, but it&amp;rsquo;s also super large where it&amp;rsquo;s not possible to do all the things you want.</description>

      <description>Last weekend I attended C2E2 at Chicago&amp;rsquo;s McCormick Place once again. It&amp;rsquo;a convention I recommend to all my Chicago friends to attend as it&amp;rsquo;s very convenient to attend and is quite affordable since they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to travel far.
If you weren&amp;rsquo;t able to attend, check out SyFy Wire&amp;rsquo;s youTube channel. They have videos of most if not all the panels that happened at C2E2 as well as many other conventions across the US.</description>

      <description>Another year, another Comic Con (SDCC) in the bag!
The programming for this year&amp;rsquo;s Comic Con was different than other years as some of the big studios were not there&amp;ndash; namely Marvel Studios and HBO. I can understand Marvel Studios not being there this year, as they are between the Infinity War movies. They don&amp;rsquo;t want to give much information away in regards to how things are going to be in the coming movies and the next phase of their movie/storytelling development.</description>

      <description>Last weekend I was at Anime Expo (AX). In general it was super fun to be taking photos of cosplayers there again. But it was a crazy hot weekend. It was 100+ &amp;#176; F every day there!
It&amp;rsquo;s been three years (2015) since I was at AX. I mostly hung out inside the South hall again. I didn&amp;rsquo;t see as many cosplayers as I thought I would, and I think that may be because of the heat, and that many notable cosplayers/photographers set up near the Staples Center out West.</description>

      <description>This year&amp;rsquo;s C2E2 was by far the largest and busiest I&amp;rsquo;ve been to. There seemed to be a bigger space rented out for the event over at McCormick Place. I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother to apply for a press pass this year and just went ahead and bought a 3-day pass. I&amp;rsquo;ve been denied 2 years in a row now and didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like applying&amp;ndash; perhaps next year.
Like many other comic conventions, C2E2 offers mailing of purchased badges if they are bought before a deadline.</description>

      <description>San Diego Comic Con (SDCC) has come and gone. This year marks my seventh year going to SDCC! Each year I have a good time, but every year it becomes less about the convention floor, offsite experiences, and buying stuff. Going to the con is now more about taking photos and attending panels.
Cosplay I love taking photos of cosplayers, but it&amp;rsquo;s really difficult to be at the right place at the right time to catch some of the awesome cosplay.</description>

      <description>This past weekend I went to C2E2 over at McCormick Place. Once again I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to obtain a press pass, so I went as a civilian photographer&amp;ndash; I bought my 3-day pass. Every year I&amp;rsquo;m going to try, and every year I&amp;rsquo;m probably going to get denied!
C2E2 isn&amp;rsquo;t too big that it&amp;rsquo;s uncomfortable to go as an individual or even as a family. McCormick Place is huge and there&amp;rsquo;s plenty of room to expand in case the crowd size does ever get bigger.</description>

      <description>Just got back from San Diego Comic Con and I&amp;rsquo;m super exhausted! My sisters and I were lucky this year and we got rooms at the Manchester Grand Hyatt, just a few blocks away from the convention center. I even nabbed myself a Superman Conan FunkoPop that was being raffled away in the very same hotel we were staying at!
The weather was hot as the sun was unforgiving most of the time during the day.</description>

      <description>Over the weekend I went to check out C2E2. It was the second year that I&amp;rsquo;ve attended the show. This year, I went all three days, unlike last year. The cosplay this year was amazing&amp;ndash; every year cosplayers keep upping their game.
Friday The main purpose of Day 1 was to pick up my lanyard, get a lay of the land, walk the exhibit hall, and determine whether I would be permitted to take photos from different positions in the main stage.</description>

      <description>Last week, the Halloween edition of Cosplay Culture magazine came out on newsstands. There is an article on San Diego Comic Con that features my photos in it. The article is a ten whopping page spread! This all started from a simple comment on an instagram photo.
You can find this magazine at Barnes and Noble, Target, Walmart, Ralph&amp;rsquo;s, Walgreens, CVS, and other major newsstands and comic shops. I found my copies at B&amp;amp;N.</description>

      <description>Last week I was in San Diego for Comic Con. This year marks my fifth time that I&amp;rsquo;ve been to San Diego Comic Con.
This month of July also marks twenty years since I attended my first comic convention in Chicago, when it was then known as Chicago Comic Con (it was bought by Wizard World in 1997).
The Good As usual, it&amp;rsquo;s always fun to go to the biggest geek party in the world.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently in California. This past week was Anime Expo in Los Angeles, and this coming week will be San Diego Comic Con in well, San Diego.
Like previous years, I attend AX mostly to take pictures of cosplays in the South Hall. Not many people realize that the lighting from the windows and structure of the building acts like a diffuser for most of the day. In other words, it makes LA&amp;rsquo;s harsh light into something fun to work with.</description>

      <description>This past Sunday I went to check out Chicago&amp;rsquo;s very own C2E2 at McCormick Place. I only went for one day unfortunately, but I had a good time walking the floor and taking pictures here and there. I really do find this con to be better than Wizard World Chicago. Not only is it bigger, with room to expand at McCormick, but the fans and cosplayers were in abundance. In short, it was way more fun.</description>

      <description>I attended my third Comikaze Expo (CE) over the weekend, October 31st through November 2nd. I had a great time again. I say this every year&amp;ndash; Comikaze keeps getting bigger and better. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what the numbers are, but the attendance on Saturday was pretty big&amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;d say probably a 30% increase from last year.
I only went on Friday and Saturday. I did go on Thursday to do an early pick up of my badge&amp;ndash; which is where and when I took the shot below of the Los Angeles Convention Center with the Comikaze Expo sign.</description>

      <description>Over the weekend I attended Long Beach Comic Con (LBCC) with my first press pass. It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve attended LBCC, two years to be exact. Back then I only went on a Sunday, but this year I attended on a Saturday to get a more full experience.
What I enjoyed about LBCC is that it&amp;rsquo;s a small con without the hassle of a big convention like San Diego Comic Con.</description>

      <description>Last week I as in San Diego for Comic Con (SDCC). This visit marks my fourth visit to San Diego&amp;rsquo;s Comic Con, with next year (2015) marking twenty years since I attended my first comic con in Chicago. I cannot believe it&amp;rsquo;s been that long since I first ventured into a convention

This year I didn&amp;rsquo;t take as many pictures as I did in previous years. I think it&amp;rsquo;s mostly because I&amp;rsquo;m more interested in attending panels and enjoying myself.</description>

headerimage: /images/headers/anime_expo.jpg This year&amp;rsquo;s Anime Expo (AX) has come and gone now. Just like the previous years, I went again to take photos of the cosplayers. For me, AX, has the best collective gatherings of cosplayers I&amp;rsquo;ve ever come across&amp;ndash; although one day I&amp;rsquo;d like to check out DragonCon, which I hear is amazing.

      <description>In a last week&amp;rsquo;s episode of Heroes of Cosplay, I had a brief appearance in Season 1 - Episode 7!
The episode covered part of the cosplay competition at Stan Lee&amp;rsquo;s Comikaze Expo. I was there in attendance checking out the event and taking photos of many cosplayers and panels.
I appear at about the 2:34 mark as the opening credits are still rolling.

      <description>This past weekend I attended BlizzCon at the Anaheim Convention Center. I had a blast taking photos of cosplayers. I must say that Blizzard fans are some of the most dedicated super fans I&amp;rsquo;ve ever met. They love the games, the stories, and are really, really into the craft of cosplay. Other than at Anime Expo, these guys have the best cosplay I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen.
This year there was some news on all fronts, minus Warcraft 3 and some other older games of course.</description>

      <description>This past weekend I went to Comikaze Expo at the Los Angeles Convention Center. Last year I blogged about my experience and I must say that this year is a huge improvement. I want to share with everyone my thoughts and pictures I took of the convention.
But first I want to say that what Comikaze is doing is important. San Diego Comic Con (SDCC) is getting so big now that many comics/sci-fi/horror fans can&amp;rsquo;t even get tickets or housing to the huge event&amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s such a hassle!</description>

      <description>Over the weekend on Sunday I went to check out Wondercon down in Anaheim. I would have loved to go all three days, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t secure tickets as they sold out days in advance&amp;ndash; which I heard was a first.
The ticket for Sunday was only $10. Not bad, but they didn&amp;rsquo;t have long hours on this Easter Sunday. However, they did open the doors early for everyone. Supposedly it said 11am, but they let people in as early as 10am.</description>

      <description>Over the weekend I attended Long Beach Comic Con held at the Long Beach Convention Center. It&amp;rsquo;s not as big as San Diego Comic Con nor Comikaze Expo, but it definitely had a more collector&amp;rsquo;s paradise feel to it.
I actually didn&amp;rsquo;t take too many pictures myself as I was head deep in the comic book bins looking for deals on actual comic books. Normally I&amp;rsquo;m more of a trade paperback (TPB) kind of comic reader, but recently started picking up some individual titles again.</description>

      <description>Over the weekend I checked out the Comikaze Expo at the LA Convention Center (LACC). As far as I know, this was the first &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; comic con taking place in Los Angeles. The previous year&amp;rsquo;s I heard took place in a parking structure or something. But this is a comic con for LA made by fans, for fans. That&amp;rsquo;s their slogan more or less anyway.
Anyway, I had fun and took a lot of pictures.</description>

      <description>Last week I went to the San Diego Comic Con (SDCC) and had a blast. The last time I went was back in 2010, which I blogged about here. I took quite a few photos, but only post-processed a fraction of them. I may choose to post-process more of them at a later date. You can view the full album here.
I attended SDCC with a 4-day pass along with preview night.</description>

      <description>A little over a week ago I attended Anime Expo (AX) held at the LA Convention Center. I had a four-day pass for June 29 - July 2, 2012. The last time I attended AX was in 2008, quite a long time ago. I recall being the odd one for not dressing up&amp;ndash; as so so very many people dress up in an anime costume!
So a motivation for attending this year was to take pictures of the costumed attendees.</description>

      <description>Over the weekend I went with my sister and friends to check out BlizzCon&amp;nbsp;at the Anaheim Convention Center. Obviously we&amp;rsquo;re all fans of the games that Blizzard Entertainment make, and it was everyone&amp;rsquo;s first time attending. We had a blast!
It was a very tiring two days (Friday and Saturday, Oct 21-22, 2011). Doors opened around 9-9:30am, and the events lasted until midnight! I went around and snapped photos as much as I could, while attending some panels and Starcraft 2 tournaments.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m suffering from San Diego Comic Con 2010 withdrawal still. This year I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to go as a good friend was getting married and I was his best man&amp;ndash; which turned out to be the best wedding I&amp;rsquo;ve ever been to. But anyway, you can see my post and pictures from that here.
So this year I made a last minute decision to go to Wizard World&amp;rsquo;s Chicago&amp;rsquo;s Comic Con.</description>
