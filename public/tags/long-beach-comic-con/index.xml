      <description>Over the weekend I attended Long Beach Comic Con (LBCC) with my first press pass. It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve attended LBCC, two years to be exact. Back then I only went on a Sunday, but this year I attended on a Saturday to get a more full experience.
What I enjoyed about LBCC is that it&amp;rsquo;s a small con without the hassle of a big convention like San Diego Comic Con.</description>

      <description>Over the weekend I attended Long Beach Comic Con held at the Long Beach Convention Center. It&amp;rsquo;s not as big as San Diego Comic Con nor Comikaze Expo, but it definitely had a more collector&amp;rsquo;s paradise feel to it.
I actually didn&amp;rsquo;t take too many pictures myself as I was head deep in the comic book bins looking for deals on actual comic books. Normally I&amp;rsquo;m more of a trade paperback (TPB) kind of comic reader, but recently started picking up some individual titles again.</description>
