      <description>This past Friday the Chicago Humanities Festival had Scott McCloud at the Art Institute. Not many of my friends and family know that Mr. McCloud was a big influence during my teenage and high school years.
Back in the nineties, I was a big comic book reader. Besides being a reader, I also loved doodling and drawing. But after a while, I wanted to know more about the history, art, and motivations of the comic book creators.</description>

      <description>This past weekend I attended BlizzCon at the Anaheim Convention Center. I had a blast taking photos of cosplayers. I must say that Blizzard fans are some of the most dedicated super fans I&amp;rsquo;ve ever met. They love the games, the stories, and are really, really into the craft of cosplay. Other than at Anime Expo, these guys have the best cosplay I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen.
This year there was some news on all fronts, minus Warcraft 3 and some other older games of course.</description>

      <description>I went to the The UnCubed event here in Los Angeles this past Thursday. I wanted to check out what startups are here in LA and see the panels. It was good event that was extremely relaxed for a job fair. It was right by the beach&amp;ndash; LA style no doubt.
I took pictures here and there, but didn&amp;rsquo;t take any of the actual job fair. I got a chance to see what companies and technologies are at play.</description>

      <title>The Stanley Kubrick Exhibit at LACMA</title>

      <description>Today I checked out the Stanley Kubrick Exhibit at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA). To be honest, I&amp;rsquo;m not all too familiar with Stanley Kubrick&amp;rsquo;s work. There are only two of his movies that I can say I watched entirely: Eyes Wide Shut and A.I. Artificial Intelligence. The latter being more Spielberg than Kubrick anyway.
I hear that a lot of people either really like Kubrick&amp;rsquo;s films, or really dislike them.</description>

      <description>Over the weekend on Sunday, I went to check out the Dark Knight Legend Exhibit at LA Live. It&amp;rsquo;s a free exhibit there, located on the top of the parking structure just north of LA Live. The exhibit runs until December 14, 2012.
There&amp;rsquo;s artwork, vehicles, models, props, costumes, and behind the scene videos from all the Batman films throughout the exhibit. I really like how close I could get to the props and costumes.</description>

      <description>I picked up a free ticket to Mobile Camp LA earlier this week and decided to attend. Overall I wasn&amp;rsquo;t too impressed with the event. It may have very well been the first of it&amp;rsquo;s kind aimed at developers, designers, and business folk. Anyway, I thought the venue was a bit of a mess as many things went wrong.  Earthquake drill at 10:15am (slightly distracting, but out of their control&amp;ndash; I understand) A lot of sessions held in a one big open space separated by cloth dividers.</description>

      <description>Last weekend I attended SoCal Code Camp held at University of Southern California (USC). Had a good time learning about new stuff as usual. The prizes here are pretty spectacular, but once again I won absolutely nothing. Nothing!
Like the one I went to earlier this year, this one was also a bit heavy on the .Net side of technology with little representation from Android and iOS, and nothing from Ruby/Rails/Java/etc.</description>

      <description>Last week I attended the Google+ Photographer&amp;rsquo;s Conference in San Francisco, May 22-23, 2012 at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts. The day before, I attended a photowalk at Golden Gate Park which I blogged about already.
Some things I observed and learned at the conference:
 Adobe Lightroom 4, Bridge, and Photoshop seem to be the digital tools of choice of many photographers. There are just as many Nikon users as there are Canon users.</description>

      <description>Last week I was up in San Francisco May 21-23 for the Google+ Photographer&amp;rsquo;s Conference. On Monday, there was an optional photowalk at about ten locations. I attended the one led by Scott Kelby at Golden Gate Park.
The photowalk was pretty fun. It&amp;rsquo;s the third photowalk I&amp;rsquo;ve been on so far, and in general I like to stray from the group, go at my own pace, and take shots of everything I find interesting.</description>

      <description>There are some conferences and conventions coming up soon that I&amp;rsquo;m pretty excited about. So far I&amp;rsquo;m definitely going to Anime Expo and Comic-Con, as I purchased tickets for those already. Recently announced is the G+ Photographers Conference, which includes a Photowalk on Monday, May 21st. I will most likely make my way up there for that&amp;ndash; about eighty-percent sure I&amp;rsquo;ll go.
I plan to take my photography gear to take plenty of pictures too!</description>

      <description>This past weekend I attended The Original Renaissance Pleasure Faire in Irwindale, California. It&amp;rsquo;s been over almost fifteen years since I attended a Renaissance Fair, the last being the Bristol Renaissance Fair in the Midwest. I was a teenager then and really loved the tasty mushrooms! I also got my older sister to buy me a broad sword!
A selection of photos I took are below. Full set can be found here.</description>

      <description>This past weekend, on Sunday April 1, 2012, I went to LA&amp;rsquo;s Thaitown to check out the Songkran (Thai New Year) celebrations along Hollywood Blvd. They closed Hollywood off from Western all the way to Normandie to have a street festival/parade. I arrived around 11am and spent about 30 minutes just trying to find parking. I ran along Hollywood just in time to catch the beginning of the parade.</description>

      <description>Over the weekend I went with my sister and friends to check out BlizzCon&amp;nbsp;at the Anaheim Convention Center. Obviously we&amp;rsquo;re all fans of the games that Blizzard Entertainment make, and it was everyone&amp;rsquo;s first time attending. We had a blast!
It was a very tiring two days (Friday and Saturday, Oct 21-22, 2011). Doors opened around 9-9:30am, and the events lasted until midnight! I went around and snapped photos as much as I could, while attending some panels and Starcraft 2 tournaments.</description>

      <description>I had a great time at RailsConf 2011, which took place in Baltimore, Maryland this year. Got the chance to meet and talk with a lot of Rails developers and passionate people. Always a good thing. I admit that I&amp;rsquo;m a Ruby Nuby, and quite a few of the talks were a little over my head, but in general there was a talk for everyone, no matter what skill level in Ruby/Rails.</description>

      <description>As part of my trip back to the US, I attended Red Dot Ruby Conf 2011 on April 22-23, 2011. This event takes place in Singapore, at the Singapore Management University (SMU).
I had an awesome time. I enjoy going to these social technology events. Got a chance to talk and hang out with a lot of smart folks. I really enjoy the Ruby/Rails community
Quick summary of the talks from the two days:</description>
