      <title>OnePlus, A Year Later</title>

      <description>I consider the OnePlus One I bought over a year ago a value phone&amp;ndash; best phone for the buck you spend. For it&amp;rsquo;s time, it was a big phone, with fantastic specs, for a low price. Even now, it&amp;rsquo;s still a good phone and is my main mobile device. The battery is good and CM12S operating system is also decent.
When I initially had CM11S running on my phone, the battery life was 2 days of regular usage.</description>

      <title>OnePlus One vs Nexus 5</title>

      <description>Last month in July, I purchased two Android phones: The Nexus 5 (N5) and the OnePlus One (OPO). I initially ordered the Nexus 5 because I was sick of waiting for an OnePlus invite that I signed up for in April. Up until then, I was using a Galaxy Nexus for two years and its overall performance was rather sluggish and could no longer hold a charge for half a day.</description>

      <title>Why I love Google Reader</title>

      <description>Yesterday some sad news hit me with Google&amp;rsquo;s decision to close Google Reader on July 1, 2013.
Why? As The Next Web wrote, Former Google Reader product manager confirms our suspicions: Its demise is all about Google+. See Brian Shih, former Google Reader Product Manager&amp;rsquo;s answer on Quora.
This is sad for me because other than Gmail and Search itself, Google Reader (GR) is the service I use the most from Google, and is a browser tab I always have open.</description>

      <description>Last week I attended the Google+ Photographer&amp;rsquo;s Conference in San Francisco, May 22-23, 2012 at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts. The day before, I attended a photowalk at Golden Gate Park which I blogged about already.
Some things I observed and learned at the conference:
 Adobe Lightroom 4, Bridge, and Photoshop seem to be the digital tools of choice of many photographers. There are just as many Nikon users as there are Canon users.</description>

      <description>Last week I was up in San Francisco May 21-23 for the Google+ Photographer&amp;rsquo;s Conference. On Monday, there was an optional photowalk at about ten locations. I attended the one led by Scott Kelby at Golden Gate Park.
The photowalk was pretty fun. It&amp;rsquo;s the third photowalk I&amp;rsquo;ve been on so far, and in general I like to stray from the group, go at my own pace, and take shots of everything I find interesting.</description>

      <title>Finished reading: In The Plex</title>
      <link>https://sunpech.com/2012/01/finished-reading-in-the-plex/</link>

      <description>I just finished reading In The Plex: How Google Thinks, Works, and Shapes Our Lives on my Kindle Fire.
Overall it was a good book with some insight into Google, but I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say that the book was well-written. It does jump around a lot and the material wasn&amp;rsquo;t presented chronologically in story-fashion. It&amp;rsquo;s currently the most up to date book on Google as it includes recent stuff such as Android, Eric Schmidt&amp;rsquo;s stepping down as CEO in 2010, and it&amp;rsquo;s failures to enter as a social network.</description>

      <title>Google Plus is for Geeks</title>

      <description>Google Plus (G+) is for geeks. It&amp;rsquo;s how it is now, and I think that&amp;rsquo;s how it&amp;rsquo;s going to be going forward, more or less.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using G+ now for about a month. I scored an invite early on, and a few days later invited a good chunk of people from my Gmail contacts. I went through the process of making circles, refining the circles, installing the add-ons into my Chrome browser, and so forth.</description>

      <description>Yesterday Google gave a presentation on the Google Nexus One. I watched it on the Gizmodo Liveblog. Ten minutes after reading the blog and looking at the pictures, I was sold. I knew I was eventually going to get it, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t know until that moment that that was the moment I was going to get it.
I bought the phone yesterday, 1/5/2010, at 1:05pm. Overnight FedEx shipping (free). It arrived today at 1:22pm.</description>

      <title>My Favorite Web App: Google Reader</title>
      <link>https://sunpech.com/2009/02/my-favorite-web-app-google-reader/</link>

      <description>Google Reader is by far my favorite web application. I reorganized many of the labels as well as added/deleted some feeds. But I truly consider this app as my gateway to the Internet. I have it set as a tab that always opens up in any of my browsers.
What makes it my favorite is that it collects all my favorite websites/blogs into one simple screen. I don&amp;rsquo;t care about actually visiting the website unless it has an article/blog post that I&amp;rsquo;m actually interested in commenting or reading comments on.</description>

      <title>Thoughts on Digg Meetup Chicago</title>

      <description>First off, let me say that I enjoy reading some of the articles posted on Digg&amp;hellip; well, I want to emphasize some. It&amp;rsquo;s a voting system, so there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of crap stories, and just a few winners here and there. But sometimes those stories are worth it. Sometimes&amp;hellip;
Anyway, I went to the Digg Meetup event yesterday with a co-worker and I thought it was just ok. Kevin Rose spoke a little, threw out some free schwag, interacted with the crowd, typical stuff.</description>
