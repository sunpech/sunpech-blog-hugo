      <description>Last weekend I was at Anime Central (ACen) which was hosted at the Donald E. Stephens Convention Center. This was my second time attending, and I was also given a press pass again.
I stuck around the main entrance hall/lobby for most of the convention hoping to catch cosplayers on their way in or out of the exhibit hall. It seemed this year a lot of cosplayers were more casual and spent more time in the exhibit hall than the entrance.</description>

      <description>This past weekend I attended Anime Central, also known as ACen. I was given a press pass and attended all three days, May 20-22nd. My main goal was to take photos of cosplayers in and out of the Donald E. Stephens Convention Center. ACen is the Midwest&amp;rsquo;s largest anime, manga, and Japanese pop culture convention. It&amp;rsquo;s the third largest anime convention, but in recent news I&amp;rsquo;ve heard it&amp;rsquo;s the second now, behind Anime Expo (AX).</description>
