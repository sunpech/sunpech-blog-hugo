      <description>There are two tech TV shows that I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying right now: Silicon Valley and Halt and Catch Fire.
They both deal with the business and culture of technology startups, but yet are pretty different from each other. They are both on their second seasons.
Silicon Valley pokes fun at the today&amp;rsquo;s tech craze in a humorous and ridiculous way. As it should be, technology is hot stuff right now and there&amp;rsquo;s so much money being thrown around as everyone thinks they are going to change the world with their product.</description>

      <description>Are you a fan of Game of Thrones like I am? Have you checked out Comic Book Girl 19&amp;rsquo;s (CBG19) youTube videos on this book/show?
Well, you should. Her epic history videos cover all the major houses (Baratheon, Stark, Targaryen, and Lannister). She has other videos too.
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read the books like me, her videos helps me appreciate the TV show immensely. I previously blogged about my Top 5 YouTube Channels for Comic Geeks, and she&amp;rsquo;s listed there as being one of my favorites.</description>
