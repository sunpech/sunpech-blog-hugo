      <description>In September 2010, I had the opportunity to visit Boston as part of my All-You-Can-Jet pass from JetBlue. As part of my trip out there, I visited Boston University, where I attended as an undergraduate from 1997 to 2001. While visiting the campus, I took some pictures of the undergraduate CS lab, where I worked long long ago. Different, but yet the same!

      <description>I was watching Joel Spolsky Tech Talk at Google about StackOverflow, and he brought up a URL on &amp;ldquo;programmer cartoon&amp;rdquo;. The link is: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/84556/whats-your-favorite-programmer-cartoon.
This may be my new favorite&amp;hellip;

Here is the original link to the comic post:http://stuffthathappens.com/blog/2008/03/05/simplicity/</description>

      <description>This is my vending machine at work. I happen to like Reeses Peanut Butter Cups. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a sweet tooth, but it&amp;rsquo;s the only snack in the entire machine I would buy.
Can you see what&amp;rsquo;s wrong?

It&amp;rsquo;s behind a 100 Grand, one of the worst pieces of candy in the entire machine. I haven&amp;rsquo;t enjoyed a 100 Grand since I was a kid, which is probably the age of the candy since everybody knows it&amp;rsquo;s stale and gross.</description>
